Let $M = \bigoplus_n M_n$ be a graded $A$-[[Module]] ([[Graded Ring]])  of finite type where $A = k[X_0,\dots,X_m]$ is the [[Polynomial Ring]] over a [[Field]] $k$ as a graded ring. 
Then the *Hilbert Function* of $M$ is $h_m(n) = dim_kM_n$.
There exists a polynomial $P_M(t)\in\mathbb{Q}[t]$ s.t. $P_M(n) = h_m(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$.
$P_M$ is called the *Hilbert Polynomial of $M$*.

If $X = Proj(R)$ is a [[Projective Variety]], then $P_R(t)=dimX$
