Most programming languages have *base types* or*primitive types* such as integers, floats or strings, with some ways of manipulating them (in contrast to compound types such as function types ([[Simply Typed Lambda Calculus]])).
For theoretical purposes, these are usually assumed to just be elements of some set $\mathcal{A}$ of types, and there is some other sets of terms of these types, where the particulars of $\mathcal{A}$ and the terms do not matter.
