A programming language has the property of *normalization*, if every term can be evaluated until it is in normal form ([[Values and Normal Forms]]) in a finite number of steps.
This is not true when a system contains general recursion ([[Fixed Point Combinators]]), but is true for simple languages.
In particular normalization holds in [[Simply Typed Lambda Calculus]] .
