When defining how a language behaves, there are generally three different methods of describing semantics 
* Operational Semantics, semantics are defined by an abstract machine describing how to move from one state to another
* Denotational Semantics, terms are mapped into *domains* using *interpretation functions* and then interpreted as mathematical objects with certain properties.
* Axiomatic Semantics, instead of defining rules for the language and then deriving laws from it, the laws are taken as axioms and then the behavior is derived
