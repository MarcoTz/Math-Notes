 Given terms $t_1,t_2$ and variable $x$ in a programming language (such as [[Untyped Lambda Calculus]]), replacing $x$ by $t_1$ in $t_2$ is written as $t_2[t_1/x]$ or alternatively $[x\mapsto t_1]t_2$. 
 In order to correctly substitute something for $x$, there are two important considerations 
 * If $x$ occurs bound in $t_2$ it cannot be replaced, for example $(\lambda x.x)\ x [\lambda y.y/x]= (\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y)$ as $x$ is bound in $\lambda x.x$ 
 * If $x$ appears free in $t_2$, meaning it will be replaced, and $y$ appears bound in $t_2$ and free in $t_1$, then replacing $t_2[t_1/x]$ might change the free occurrence of $y$ into a bound occurrence, for example $(\lambda x. x\ y)[y/x]=\lambda x.x\ x$ which is no longer the same term. In this case we say $x$ got *captured* during the replacement. To avoid capturing, we might need to $\alpha$-rename, that is make sure $t_1$ and $t_2$ do not share any common variables before performing the substitution, by renaming variables until that is the case. An alternative to this is [[The Locally Nameless Representation]]
