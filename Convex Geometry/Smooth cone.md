Let $\sigma$ be a [[Rational Polyhedral Cone]]. Then $\sigma$ is *smooth* if it can be generated by a subset of a basis of the [[Lattice]].

$\sigma$ is smooth iff $U_{\sigma}$ is smooth ([[Affine Toric Variety]],[[Singularities]]).
All smooth affine toric varieties have the form $U_{\sigma}$ for a smooth rational polyhedral cone $\sigma$.
