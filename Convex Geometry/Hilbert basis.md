Let $\sigma \subseteq N_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a strongly convex rational polyhedral cone ([[Strongly convex cone]],[[Rational Polyhedral Cone]]) and $S_{\sigma} = \sigma^{\vee} \cap M$.
Then $\mathcal{H} = \{m\in S_{\sigma} | m \text{ is irreducible} \}$ is called the *Hilbert basis* of $S_{\sigma}$ and its elements are called *minimal generators of $S_{\sigma}$* .
$\mathcal{H}$ has the following properties 
* $\mathcal{H}$ is finite and generates $S_{\sigma}$
* $\mathcal{H}$ contains the ray generators of the edges of $\sigma^{\vee}$
* $\mathcal{H}$ is the minimal generating set of $S_{\sigma}$ wrt inclusion
