A [[Convex Polyhedral Cone]] $\sigma \subseteq N_{\mathbb{R}} = N\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{R}$ is called *rational* if $\sigma = Cone(S)$ for some finite set $S\subseteq N$. 
Let $\rho$ be an edge of $\sigma$ ([[Face of a Cone]]), then the semigroup $\rho\cap N$ is generated by a unique element $u_{\rho}$ called the *ray generator* of $\rho$.
The ray generators of $\sigma^{\vee}$ ([[Dual Polyhedral Cone]]) are called *facet normals* of $\sigma$.

Any strongly convex ([[Strongly convex cone]]) rational polyhedral cone is generated by the ray generators of its edges. 
We call these the *minimal generators of $\sigma$*
A strongly convex rational polyhedral cone $\sigma$ is called *smooth* or *regular* if its minimal generators form part of a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis of $N$.
$\sigma$ is called *simplicaial* if its minimal generators are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$
