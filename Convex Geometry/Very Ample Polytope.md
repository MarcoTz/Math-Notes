A [[Lattice]] [[Polytope]] $P\subseteq M_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called *very ample* if for each vertex $m$ of $P$, the [[Semigroup]] $S_{P,m} = \mathbb{N}(P\cap M - m)$ generated by $P\cap M -m = \{m^{\prime} - m | m^{\prime} \in P\cap M\}$ is saturated in $M$ ([[Saturated affine semigroup]]).

Any normal lattice polytope ([[Normal Polytope]]) is very ample.
Thus for any full-dimensional lattice polytope $M_{\mathbb{R}}$ we have 
* if $\dim P \geq 2$ then $kP$ is very ample for $k\geq n-1$
* if $\dim P =2$ then $P$ is very ample.
