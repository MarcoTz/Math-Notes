Let $\sigma \subseteq N_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a [[Convex Polyhedral Cone]]. If the origin is a face of $\sigma$ ([[Face of a Cone]]), $\sigma$ is called *strongly convex*.

The following are equivalent 
* $\sigma$ is strongly convex 
* $\{0\}$ is a face of $\sigma$
* $\sigma$ contains no positive-dimensional subspace of $N_{\mathbb{R}}$
* $\sigma \cap (-\sigma) = \{0\}$ 
* $\dim \sigma^{\vee} = n$ ([[Dual Polyhedral Cone]])
