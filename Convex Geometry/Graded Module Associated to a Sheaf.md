Let $S$ be a [[Graded Ring]], $X=ProjS$ [[Projective Scheme]]and $\mathcal{F}$ a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules [[Sheaf of Modules]]. Then the *graded $S$-module associated to $\mathcal{F}$*  is defined as follows. It is the [[group]] $\Gamma_*(\mathcal{F}) =  \bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \Gamma(X,\mathcal{F}(n))$ with product of $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(d))$ and $t\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n))$ as the image of $s\otimes t$ under the natural map $\mathcal{F}(n) \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(d) \cong \mathcal{F}(n+d)$ and natural grading.

For any ring $A$, $S=A[x_0,\dots,x_r]$ and $X=ProjS$, we have $\Gamma_*(\mathcal{O}_X)\cong S$ (this is not true in general).

If $S$ is a graded ring, that is finitely generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0$-algebra ([[Algebra]]) with $X=ProjS$ and a quasi-coherent sheaf ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) on $X$. Then there is a natural isomorphism $\beta:\Gamma_*(\mathcal{F})\tilde{} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$
