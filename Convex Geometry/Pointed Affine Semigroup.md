An [[Affine Semigroup]] $S$ is called *pointed* if $S\cap (-S) = \{0\}$, i.e. if $0$ is the only invertible element of $S$.

If $V = Spec(\mathbb{C}[S])$ ([[Affine Toric Variety]]), then the torus action has a fixed point iff $S$ is pointed, and the fixed point is given by the semigroup homomorphism $S\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$, $0\mapsto 1$, $m\mapsto 0$ for $m\neq 0$.
