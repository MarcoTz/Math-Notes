A full-dimensional [[Lattice]] [[Polytope]] $P\subseteq M_{\mathbb{R}}$ is *reflexive* if it has facet representation $P = \{ m\in M_{\mathbb{R}} | \langle m,u_F\rangle \geq -1 \forall \text{ facets } F\}$.
If $P$ is reflexive, $0$ is the only interior lattice point of $P$ and $P^{\circ}$ is also a reflexive lattice polytope.

Every smooth full-dimensional lattice polytope $P$ is very ample ([[Very Ample Polytope]])
