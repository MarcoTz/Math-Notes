A relation $\leq$ on a set $P$ is called a *non-strict partial order*, if it satisfies the following

1. Reflexivity: $a\leq a\forall a \in P$
2. Antisymmetry: $a\leq b, b\leq a \Rightarrow a = b$
3. Transitivity: $a\leq b,b\leq c\Rightarrow a\leq c$ 

If reflexivity is replaced with irreflexivity (i.e. $a\not \leq a\forall a\in P$) the partial order is called *strict*.

If the above three hold and for each $a,b\in P$ we have $a\leq b$ or $b\leq a$ then the order is called a *total order*.
