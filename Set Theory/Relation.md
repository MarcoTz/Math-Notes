A Relation $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of $A\times B$.
If $(a,b) \in R$, we often write $a\sim b$  or $a \sim_R b$ 

#### Equivalence Relations

An equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $X$, is a [[Relation]] with the following properties:

1. Reflexivity: $\forall x\in X: x\sim x$
2. Symmetry: $x\sim y \Rightarrow y\sim x$
3. Transitivity: $x\sim y \vee y \sim z \Rightarrow x \sim z$ 

###### Equivalence Classes

Given a Equivalence Relation on a set $X$, the equivalence class of an element $x\in X$ is the set 

$[x]= \{y\in X : x~y\}$

An element of $[x]$ is called a *representant* of $[x]$ or that $x\in[x]$ represents $[x]$.
The set of equivalence classes of $X$ define a [[Partition]] of $X$.
