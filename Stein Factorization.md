Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a [[Projective Morphism]] of [[Noetherian Scheme]]s. Then $f=g\circ f^{\prime}$ with $f^{\prime}: X\rightarrow Y^{\prime}$ is a projective morphism with connected fibres and $g:Y^{\prime} \rightarrow Y$ is a finite morphism ([[Finite Morphisms of Schemes]]).

This follows from the [[Theorem on Formal Functions]].
