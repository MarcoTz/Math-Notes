For [[Natural numbers]] $n,k$, the *binomial coefficient* ${n\choose k}$ is defined as 

$$ {n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$ 
The binomial coefficient ${n\choose k}$ is the $k$th coefficient of the polynomial $(1+x)^n$.
We have $\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} = 2^n$ and ${n\choose k} =  {n-1 \choose k} + {n-1 \choose k-1}$
