An *abelian category* $\mathfrak{U}$ is a [[Category]] s.t. for each $A,B\in Ob\mathfrak{U}$, $Hom(A,B)$ has the structure of an [[Abelian Group]], the composition law is linear, finite direct sums exists, every morphism has kernel and cokernel, every monomorphism is the kernel of its cokernel, every epimorphism is the cokernel of its kernel and every morphism can be factored into an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism ([[Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms]],[[Kernels and Cokernels]]).
