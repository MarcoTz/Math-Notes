Let $C$ be a [[Category]] and $f\in Hom(X,Y)$be a morphism in $C$. Then $f$ is called *constant* (or *left zero*) if for every object $W$ of $C$ and $g,h\in Hom(W,X)$ we have $fg=fh$. 
$f$ is called *coconstant* (or *right zero*) if for any object $Z$ in $C$ and any morphisms $g,h\in Hom(Y,Z)$ we have $gf=hf$.
A constant and coconstant morphism is called *zero morphism*. 
A category with zero morphisms is a category s.t. for any two objects $A,B$ there is a zero morphism $0_{AB}\in Hom(A,B)$
