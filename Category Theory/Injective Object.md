Let $\mathfrak{U}$ be an [[Abelian Category]]. Then an object $I$ of $\mathfrak{U}$ is called *injective* if the functor $Hom(\cdot,I)$ is exact ([[Exact Functor]]).

If every object of $\mathfrak{U}$ is isomorphic to some injective object of $\mathfrak{U}$, we say $\mathfrak{U}$ has *enough injectives*. 
If $\mathfrak{U}$ has enough injectives, every object has an [[Injective Resolution]].

If $A$ is a [[Ring]], then every $A$-[[Module]] is isomorhpic to a submodule of an injective $A$-module.

For a [[Ringed Space]] $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$, the [[category]] $\mathfrak{Mod}(X)$ of sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules ([[Sheaf of Modules]] ) has enough injectives.
As a corollary, for a [[Topological Space]] $X$, the category $\mathfrak{Ub}(X)$ of sheaves of [[Abelian Group]]s on $X$ has enough injectives.

On a [[Noetherian Ring]] $A$ with ideal $a$ and injective $A$-module $I$, the submodule $J = \Gamma_a(I)$ is also injective, where $\Gamma_a(I) = \{m\in I | a^nm = 0$ for some $n>0\}$.
Furthermore, for any $f\in A$, the canonical map $I\rightarrow I_f$ ([[Localization]]) is surjective.
