Let $C$ be a [[Category]] and $f\in Hom(X,Y)$ for some objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$. 
Then $f$ is called a *monomorphism* if for all objects $Z$ and all morphisms $g_1,g_2\in Hom(Z,X)$ we have 

$$ f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2 $$
$f$ is called an *epimorphism*, if for all objects $Z$ and morhpisms $g_1,g_2\in Hom(Y,Z)$ we have 

$$ g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2 $$
