Let $F:\mathfrak{U} \rightarrow \mathfrak{B}$ be a covariant [[Functor]] between abelian categories ([[Abelian Category]]) and $0\rightarrow A^{\prime}\rightarrow A \rightarrow A^{\prime\prime} \rightarrow 0$ be a short [[Exact Sequence]] in $\mathfrak{U}$.
Then $F$ is called *left exact* if it is additive ([[Additive Functor]]) and the sequence $0\rightarrow FA^{\prime} \rightarrow FA \rightarrow FA^{\prime\prime}$ is exact.
$F$ is called *right exact* if it is additive and $FA^{\prime} \rightarrow FA \rightarrow FA^{\prime\prime} \rightarrow 0$ is exact.
$F$ is called *exact in the middle* if $FA^{\prime}\rightarrow FA \rightarrow FA^{\prime\prime}$ is exact. 
If $F$ is left exact and right exact it is called *exact*.
If $F$ is contravariant, the analogous definitions apply.
