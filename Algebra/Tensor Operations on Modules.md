Let $A$ be a [[Ring]] and $M$ an $A$-[[Module]]. Then let $T^n(M) = M\otimes \dots \otimes M$ be the [[Tensor Product]] of $n$ copies of $M$, with $T^0(M) = A$.
We call $T(M) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} T^n(M)$ the *tensor algebra* of $M$, $S(M) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}S^n(M)$ the *symmetric algebra* of $M$. 
It is the two-sided [[Ideal]] of $T(M)$ generated by all expressions $x\otimes y-y\otimes x$ for $x,y\in M$ and a commutative $A$-algebra. The component $S^n(M)$ of degree $n$ is called the *nth symmetric product* of $M$. We write $xy$ for the image of $x\otimes y$ in $S(M)$
The *exterior algebra* $\bigwedge(M) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} \bigwedge^n(M)$ of $M$ is the quotient of $T(M)$ by the two-sided ideal generated by all expressions $x\otimes x$ for $x\in M$. $\bigwedge M$ is a skew-commutative graded $A$-algebra ([[Gradings]]). We write $\wedge$ for the multiplication in $\bigwedge M$
