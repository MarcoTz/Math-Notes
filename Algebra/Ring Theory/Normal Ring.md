Let $A$ be a [[Noetherian Ring]]. Then $A$ is called *normal* if for each [[Prime Ideal]] $p\subseteq A$ the [[Localization]] $A_p$ is integrally closed. 

### Serre's Theorem

Let $A$ be a noetherian ring. Then $A$ is normal iff the following conditions are satisfied 

* for every prime ideal $p\subseteq A$ of height $\leq 1$, $A_p$ is regular (i.e. a [[Field]] or [[Valuation Ring]])
* for every prime ideal $p\subseteq A$ of height $\geq 2$, $depthA_p \geq 2$ ([[Regular Sequence]])
