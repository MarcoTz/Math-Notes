A *graded ring* $A$ is a [[Ring]] $A$ with a decomposition $A=\bigoplus_{k\geq 0} A_k$ of additive Subgroups ([[Group#Subgroups]]), s.t. we have $a_ka_l \in A_{k+l}$ for $a_k\in A_k$ and $a_l\in A_l$ .

If $k$ is the smallest integer with $a\in A_k$ we say $a$ has *degree* or *dimension* $k$, wirtten $deg(a)=|a|=k$.

A graded ring $A$ is said to be *commutative* if we have $ab = (-1)^{|a||b|}ba$. 
To distinguish from the regular notion of a commutative ring, we sometimes use *graded commutative*, *anticommutative* or *skew commutative* instead.

Graded [[Module]]s and [[Vector Space]]s are defined similarly.


### Homogeneous Ideal 

An [[Ideal]] $I$ of a graded ring $A$ is called *homogeneous ideal* if $I=\bigoplus_{k\geq 0} (I\cap A_k)$.
$I$ is homogeneous iff it is generated by homogeneous elements (i.e. elements in some $A_k$).
Sums, products, intersections and radicls of homogeneous ideals are homogeneous. 
Homogeneous ideals are prime ideals if for any two homogeneous elements $f,g\in A$ with $fg\in I$ we have $f\in I$ or $g\in I$.
