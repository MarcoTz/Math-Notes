Any polynomial ([[Polynomial Ring]]) $f\in R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ can be written as a sum of [[Monomials]]  $f = f_1,\dots,f_n$. 
Then we define the weight of $f$ as $\omega(f) = max_i\{f_i\}$ and the degree of $f$ as $\Gamma(f) = deg(f) = max_i\{f_i\}$.
For $f\in R[X]$ with $f = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ we have $degf = n$
