A commutative, zero-divisor free [[Ring]] $R$ is called a *factorial* ring or *unique faactorization domain (UFD)*, if 

1. Each $a\in R\setminus R^{\times}$ can be written as $a=q_1\dots q_n$ with irreducible elements $q_1,\dots,q_n$ ([[Irreducible and Prime Elements]])
2. The irreducible representation $a=q_1\dots q_n$ is unique up to the order of the $q_i$ and multiplication by units ([[Ring#Units]])

The following are equivalent

1. $R$ is a factorial rign
2. every irreducible element of $R$ is prime and every $a\in R\setminus R^{\times}$ can be written as a product of irreducible elements
3. every $a\in R\setminus R^{\times}$ can be written as a product of prime elements

Every [[Euclidean Ring]] is factorial.
Every principal ideal domain ([[Ideal#Principal Ideal]]) is factorial.
