A *maximal ideal* is an [[ideal]], that is not contained in any other proper ideal (i.e. that is not the entire [[ring]]).
All maximal ideals are prime ideals.
A ring with a single maximal ideal is called a *[[Local Ring]]*.
If $m\subseteq R$ is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring, then $R/m$ is a [[Field]] ([[Quotient Ring]]), called the *residue field* of $R$ mod $m$.
