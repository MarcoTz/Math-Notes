A [[Ring]] $R$ is called a *local ring*, if $R$ has a single [[Maximal Ideal]].

If $A,B$ are local rings contained in a [[Field]] $K$, we say $B$ *dominates* $A$ if $A\subseteq B$ and $m_B \cap A = m_A$.

A ring homomorphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ of local rings with maximal ideals $m_A$ and $m_B$ is called local ring homomorphism if $f^{-1}(m_B) = m_A$ 

### Regular Local Ring

A local [[Noetherian Ring]] with maximal ideal $m$ and residue field $k=A/m$ is called a *regular local ring* if $dim_k m/m^2 = dim A$ (as a [[Vector Space]])
