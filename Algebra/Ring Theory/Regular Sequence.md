Let $A$ be a [[Ring]], $M$ an $A$-[[Module]] and $x_1,\dots,x_r\in A$. Then the $x_i$ are called a *regular  sequence* for $M$ if $x_1$ is not a zero divisor in $M$ and for $i>1$, $x_i$ is not a zero divisor in $M/(x_1,\dots,x_{i-1})M$ .
If $A$ is a [[Local Ring]] with maximal ideal $m$, the *depth* of $M$ is the maxiumum length of a regular sequence $x_1,\dots,x_r$ for $M$ with all $x_i\in m$.
