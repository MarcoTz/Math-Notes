Let $R$ be a [[Ring]], that is an integral domain ([[Ring#Zero Divisors]]). Then the relation

$(x_1,y_1)\sim (x_2,y_2) \Leftrightarrow x_1y_2 = x_2y_2$ 

is an equivalence Relation ([[Relation#Equivalence Relations]]) on $R\times R^* = R\times R\setminus \{0\}$.
We denote the equivalence class of $(x,y)$ by $\frac{x}{y}$ and the set of all equivalence classes by $Q(R) = (R\times R^*)/\sim$ . On $Q(R)$ we define

$\frac{x_1}{y_1} + \frac{x_2}{y_2} = \frac{x_1y_2+x_2y_2}{y_1y_2}$ and $\frac{x_1}{y_1}\frac{x_2}{y_2} = \frac{x_1x_2}{y_1y_2}$ 

With these operations, $Q(R)$ is a [[Field]], called *quotient field* of $R$
