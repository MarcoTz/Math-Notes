A *ring* is a tripel $(R,+,\cdot)$ with a set ([[Sets#Sets]]) and two maps

$+ : R\times R \rightarrow R \quad (x,y)\mapsto x+y$ 
$\cdot : R\times R \rightarrow R \quad (x,y) \mapsto x\cdot y = xy$ 

satisfying the following conditions 

1. $(R,+)$ is an [[Abelian Group]]
2. $(R.\cdot)$ is a [[Monoid]]
3. Distributivity: $x(y+z) = xy+xz \forall x,y,z\in R$ and $(x+y)z = xz+yz \forall x,y,z\in R$

The group $(R,+)$ is usually called the *additive group* of $R$ with  neutral element $0$, and $(R,\cdot)$ is called the *multiplicative monoid* with neutral element $1$.
For a ring the following always holds

1. $0x = x0 = 0 \forall x \in R$
2. $x(-y) = (-x)y = -xy \forall x,y\in R$
3. $(-x)(-y) = xy \forall x,y\in R$

#### Units

An element $x\in R$ of a ring is called a *unit*, if it has a multiplicative inverse, i.e. there is a $x^{-1}\in R$ with $xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1$.
The multiplicative group containing all units of $R$ is called the *unit group* of $R$ and denoted by $R^{\times}$.
If $R\neq \{0\}$ and $R^{\times} = R\setminus \{0\}$ we call $R$ a  *division ring*.
If the multiplication in $R$ is also commutative, $R$ is a [[Field]].

#### Subrings

A subset $S\subseteq R$ that is a ring with addition and multiplication from $R$ is called a *subring* (similar to subgroups [[Group#Subgroups]]) .  $S$ is a subring if it satisfies the following conditions 

1. $1\in S$
2. $x-y\in S \forall x,y\in S$
3. $xy\in S\forall x,y\in S$

#### Zero Divisors

Elements $x,y\in R$ with $x\neq 0$ and $y\neq 0$  such that $xy = 0$ are called *zero divisors* in $R$.
If $R$ has no zero divisors, it is called *zero divisor free*. 
If for an element $x$ there is some $n$ with $x^n=0$ , $x$ is called *nilpotent* 

#### Characteristic and prime ring

The smallest $n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n\cdot 1=1+\dots+1 = 0$ is called *characteristic* of $R$.
The subring of $R$, generated by $1$ is called the *prime ring* of $R$


#### Divisors

$x\in R$ is called *divisor* of $y\in R$ if $y=qx$ for some $q\in R$.
This is equivalent to $Ry\subseteq Rx$


#### Associated Elements

Two elements $a,b$ of a ring $R$ are called *associated* if there is a unit $r\in R^{\times}$ with $a=rb$, written $a\sim b$.

### Krull Dimension

The *Krull dimension* of a ring $R$ is the supremum of all heights of [[Prime Ideal]]s of $R$.
