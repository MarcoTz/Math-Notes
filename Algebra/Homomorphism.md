A *homomorphism* $f:A\rightarrow B$ is a map between algebraic objects, that is compatible with the properties of the objects.

For example, a [[Group Homomorphism]] satisfies $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$ and a [[Ring Homomorhpism]] satisfies $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$.

For a [[Homomorphism]] $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$, we define 

* The *Image* $im \varphi = \{ \varphi(g) | g \in G \}$ .
* The *Kernel* $\ker \varphi = \varphi^{-1}(e)$ 

#### Monomorphisms, Epimorphisms and Isomorphisms

Let $\varphi : G\rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism, then 

* If $\varphi$ is an Injection, it is called a *Monomorphism*
* If $\varphi$ is a Surjection, it is called an *Epimorphism*
* If $\varphi$ is a Bijection, it is called an *Isomorphism*. In this case we say $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic* and write $G\cong H$.
* If $G=H$ and $\varphi$ is an Isomorphism, we say $\varphi$ is an *Automorphism*. We denote the [[group]] of Automorphisms (under Composition) of $G$ by $Aut(G)\subseteq S(G)$
