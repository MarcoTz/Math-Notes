A map ([[Function]])  $f:G\rightarrow H$ between two [[Group]]s $G$ and $H$ is called a *homomorphism*, if $f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \forall x,y\in G$ 

For an homomorphism $f$ we have $f(e) = e$ and $f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}$
The image of a group homomorphism is always a subgroup.
The preimage of any group of $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ (so $ker\varphi$ in particular).

$Ker \varphi = \{e\} \Leftrightarrow \varphi$ Monomorphism 
([[Homomorphism#Monomorphisms Epimorphisms and Isomorphisms]])

#### Homomorphism Theorem
Let $\varphi: G\rightarrow H$ be a [[Group Homomorphism]], then $N=ker\varphi$ is a [[Normal Subgroup]] of $G$ and

$G/N \cong \varphi(G)$
