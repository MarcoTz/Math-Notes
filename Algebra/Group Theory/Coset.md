Given a [[Group]] $G$ with a Subgroup $H$, for any $g\in G$ the set 

* $gH = \{gh | h \in H\}$ is the *left coset* of $g$ 
* $Hg = \{hg | h \in H\}$ is the *right coset* of $g$

The [[Relation]] $x\sim y \Leftrightarrow \exists h \in H : x = yh$ is a Equivalence Relation (similarly for right cosets), so the left (right) cosets define a [[Partition]] of $G$.
We call the number of left cosets the *index* of $H$, denoted $[G:H]$
