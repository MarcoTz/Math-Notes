#### Outer Product 

The *outer product* of [[Group]]s $G_1,\dots, G_n$ is the set $G_1\times \dots \times G_n$  with product $(g_1,\dots,g_n) \cdot (h_1,\dots,h_n) = (g_1h_1,\dots,g_nh_n)$ 

If all groups $G_1,\dots, G_n$ are [[Abelian Group]]s, we write $\bigoplus_i G_i$  and use $+$ for the product.

#### Direct Product

If $G$ is a group with subgroups $H_1,\dots, H_k$, then $G$ is the *direct product* of $H_1,\dots,H_k$ if 

1. for each $i$ $H_i$ is a [[Normal Subgroup]]
2. each $g\in G$ has a unique representation $g=h_1\dots h_k$ with $h_i\in H_i$ for each $i$

If $G$ is the direct product of $H_1,\dots,H_k$ then 

$G\cong H_1\times \dots \times H_k$

Furthermore, for $g_i\in H_i$ and $g_j\in H_j$ with $i\neq j$ we have $g_ig_j = g_jg_i$

If $|G| = p_1^{l_1}\dots p_k^{l_k}$ for primes $p_1,\dots,p_k$ s.t. for each $p_i$ there is only one $p_i$-Sylowgroup (see [[Sylow Theorems]]), then $G$ is the direct product of $H_1,\dots, H_k$.
In particular, every group of order $15$ is cyclic.
