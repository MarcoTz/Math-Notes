The *free group* in generators $\{a_i\}_{i\in I}$ is the [[Abelian Group]] generated by the elements $a_i$, where each $a_i$ has infinite order ([[Group#Order]]). 
If $I$ is finite, this group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{|I|}$.

### Free Product

The *free product* of groups $G_{\alpha}$, denoted $\ast_{\alpha} G_{\alpha}$ consists of all finite words $g_1,\dots g_m$ where each $g_i$ belongs to some group $G_{\alpha_i}$. If no two adjacent elements in such a word are in the same group and no $g_i$ is the identiyt element, the word is said to be *reduced*.
Any not reduced word, can be simplified to a reduced word, by replacing adjacent elements in the same group by their product in the group and removing any identity elements. Any element of the free product is the same as its reduced element.
The product of two elements is just writing the two elements after each other, and the inverse of $g_1\dots g_m$ is the element $g_m^{-1}\dots g_1^{-1}$.

### Free resolution

A free resolution of an [[abelian group]] $H$ is an [[Exact Sequence]] 
$$ \dots \rightarrow F_2 \xrightarrow{f_2} F_1 \xrightarrow{f_1} F_0 \xrightarrow{f_0} H \rightarrow 0 $$ where each $F_i$ is free.

If $H$ and $H^{\prime}$ are two abelian groups with free resolutions $F$ and $F^{\prime}$ and $\alpha : H\rightarrow H^{\prime}$ a [[Homomorphism]]. Then $\alpha$ can be extended to a chain map ([[Chain Complexes#Chain maps]]) from $F$ to $F^{\prime}$

$$ \begin{array} 
\dots & \rightarrow & F_2 & \xrightarrow{f_2} & F_1 & \xrightarrow{f_1} & F_0  & \xrightarrow{f_0} & H & \rightarrow & 0 \\
& & \downarrow _{\alpha_2} & & \downarrow _{\alpha_1} & & \downarrow _{\alpha_0} & & \downarrow _{\alpha} \\
\dots & \rightarrow & F^{\prime}_2 & \xrightarrow{f^{\prime}_2} & F^{\prime}_1 & \xrightarrow{f^{\prime}_1} & F^{\prime}_0  & \xrightarrow{f^{\prime}_0} & H^{\prime} & \rightarrow & 0 \\

\end{array}$$

Any two such maps extending $\alpha$ are chain homotopic.
Furthermore, for two free resolutions $F$ and $F^{\prime}$ of $H$, there are canonical isomorphisms $H^n(F;G)\cong H^n(F^{\prime};G)$ where these denote the [[Cohomology]] groups of the dual chain
