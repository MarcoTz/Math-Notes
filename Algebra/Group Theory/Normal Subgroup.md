A Subgroup $N$ of a [[Group]] $G$ is called *normal* if the following equivalent conditions hold

* $\forall g\in G: gNg^{-1}\subseteq N$
* $\forall g\in G: gNg^{-1} = N$ 
* $\forall g\in G: gN = Ng$ , i.e. left and right [[Coset]]s are equal

### Normalizer

For any subgroup $H\subseteq G$, the normalizer of $H$ is defined as $N_G(H)= \{g\in G | gH = Hg\}$
This is also a subgroup of $G$ and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $N_G(H)$.
