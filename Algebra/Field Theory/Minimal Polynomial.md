Let $L:K$ be a [[Field Extension]], with $a\in L$ algebraic over $K$ ([[Algebraic Field extension]]). A normed polynomial ([[Polynomial Ring]]) $\mu_a\in K[t]$ is called *minimal polynomial* of $a$ if $\mu_a(a) = 0$ and every other $f\in K[t]$ with $f(a) = 0$ has higher degree than $\mu_a$. 
$\mu_a$ has the following properties 

* $\mu_a$ is irreducible in $K[t]$
* if $f\in K[t]$ is a polynomial with $f(a) = 0$, then $\mu_a$ is a divisor of $f$ ([[Ring#Divisors]])
* if $f\in K[t]$ is irreducible, normed and $f(a)=0$ then $f=\mu_a$. In particular, $\mu_a$ is unique.
