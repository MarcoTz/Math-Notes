Let $L/K$ be a [[Field Extension]]

### Algebraic Independence

A set of elements $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ in $L$ is called *algebraically independent* over $K$ if there is no nonzero polynomial $f\in K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$  with $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0$.

The largest size $n$ s.t. there is an algebraically independent set with $n$ elements is called the *degree of transcendence* of $L/K$, written $trdeg_K(L)$.
