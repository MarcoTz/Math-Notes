Let $K$ be a [[Field]]. The order of $1$ in the additive group of $K$ is called *characteristic* of $K$, if the order is finite, and $0$ otherwise.
We write $charK$ for the characteristic. $CharK$ is always $0$ or a prime number.

We have 
$CharK=0 \Leftrightarrow P(K)\cong\mathbb{Q}$ and 
$CharK = p\neq 0 \Leftrightarrow P(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{F}_p$ 

If $CharK = p$ we have $(x\pm y)^{p^k} = x^{p^k} \pm y^{p^k} \forall x,y\in K, k\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$
