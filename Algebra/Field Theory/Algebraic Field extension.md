Let $L:K$ be a [[field extension]]. An element $a\in L$ is called *algebraic* over $K$ if there is a polynomial ([[Polynomial Ring]]) $0\neq f \in K[X]$ with $f(a) = 0$ .
Elements that are not algebraic are called *transcendental* over $K$.
If every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$, $L$ is called an *algebraic field extension*. The smallest field extension that is algebraic is called the *algebraic closure* of a field.

$\pi \in \mathbb{R}$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$ 
Every finite field extension $L:K$ is algebraic.
