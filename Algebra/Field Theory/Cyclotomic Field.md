For any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i/n}\in \mathbb{C}$ is called the *$n$-primitive unit root*. 
$\Phi_n(t) = \Pi_{1\leq k\leq n-1: gcd(n,k) = 1} t-\zeta_n^k$  is called the *n-th cyclotomic polynomial*.
The [[Splitting Field]] of $\Phi_n$ is called *Cyclotomic Field*, denoted $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ or $\mathbb{Q}_n$

We have the equation $t^n-1 = \Pi_{d|n} \Phi_d(t)$
$\Phi_n$ is a normed polynomial of degree $\varphi(n)$ ([[Eulers Totient Function]]) with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. It is irreducible ([[Irreducible and Prime Elements]]) over $\mathbb{Q

The [[Galois Group]] $Gal(\mathbb{Q}_n/\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$
