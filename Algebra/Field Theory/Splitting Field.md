Let $K$ be a [[field]], $f\in K[t]$ a polynomial with degree $d>0$. A [[Field Extension]] $[L:K]$ is called *splitting field* of $f$ if 

1. There are $a_1,\dots, a_d\in L$ and $c\in K$ s.t. $f = c(t-a_1)\dots (t-a_d)$ 
2. $L = K(a_1,\dots,a_d)$

If we have a field tower $K\subseteq M \subseteq L$ s.t. $L$ is the splitting field of $f\in K[t]$ then $L$ is also the splitting field of $f\in M[t]$.
For every $f\in K[t]$ with degree $d>0$ there is a splitting field $L:K$ with $[L:K]\leq d!$
