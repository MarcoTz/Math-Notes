Let $K$ be a [[Field]] If every irreduzible polynomial ([[Irreducible and Prime Elements]]) in $K[t]$ is separable ([[Separability]]), $K$ is called a *perfect field*.

A field $K$ with $CharK = p \neq 0$ is perfect iff $\varphi : K \rightarrow K \quad a \mapsto a^p$ is surjective.
Every finite field is perfect and every algebraic field is as well ([[Algebraic Field extension]])
