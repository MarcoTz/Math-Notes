A [[Field Extension]] $L:K$ is *normal* if 
1. $L:K$ is an [[Algebraic Field extension]]
2. every irreducible $f\in K[t]$  ([[Irreducible and Prime Elements]], [[Polynomial Ring]]) with root in $L$ splits into a product of linear factors in $L$

Every quadratic field extension is normal.
Any intermediate field $K^{\prime}$ in a normal finite field extension $L:K$ is also normal.

#### Normality Condition

Every finite field extension $L:K$ is normal iff $L$ is the [[Splitting Field]] of a polynomial $f(t) \in K[t]$.

Therefore, any finite field extension can be extended to a normal one.
