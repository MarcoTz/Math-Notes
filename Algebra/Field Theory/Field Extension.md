If $F$ and $L$ are [[field]]s with $F\subseteq L$, we say $L$ is a *field extension* of $F$, written $L:K$ or $L/K$ (not to confuse with [[Quotient Ring]]s or [[Quotient Group]]s).

If $F\subseteq M \subseteq L$ are Fields, $M$ is called an *intermediate field*.

The minimal subfield of a field $F$ is called *prime field* and denoted $P(F)$.

A sequence $F_1\subseteq F_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq F_n$ is called *field tower*.

#### Kronecker's Theorem

Let $p\in K[t]$ be an irreducible polynomial ([[Polynomial Ring]], [[Irreducible and Prime Elements]]) with $deg p = n > 0$. Then there is a field extension $L:K$ with $[L:K]=n$ s.t. there is an $a\in L$ that is a root of $p$. 
Then $p$ is the [[Minimal Polynomial]] of $a$ over $K$.

#### Primitive Element Theorem

Every finite, separable ([[Separability]]) field extension L:K is a [[#Simple Extension]].

In particular, if $L=K(a,b):K$ is an algebraic extension with $b$ separable over $K$, then $L:K$ is simple.
