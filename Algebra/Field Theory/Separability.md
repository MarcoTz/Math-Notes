A polynomial $f\in K[t]$ with $K$ a [[Field]] is *separable* if $gcd(f,f^{\prime})=1$, where $f^{\prime}$ denotes the derivative ([[Polynomial Ring#Derivative]]).
This is equivalent to $f^{\prime}$ not being constant zero. In particular, if $charK= 0$ then $f$ is always separable

#### Seperable Field Extension

If $L:K$ is a [[Algebraic Field extension]] and $a\in L$, $a$ is called *separable over $K$* if $\mu_a$ ([[Minimal Polynomial]]) is separable.
If all elements in $L$ are separable over $K$, $L$ is called a *separable field extension*.

For a perfect field $K$, every extension is separable.
