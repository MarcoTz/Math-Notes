Finite [[Field]]s $K$ with $CharK =p$ and $[K:P(K)] = n$ ([[Field Extension#]]) have exactly $p^n$ elements.
We denote fields with exactly $p$ elements by $\mathbb{F}_p$

For every prime $p$ and $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there is a field with $p^n$ elements.
The [[Splitting Field]] of $t^{p^n}-t\in \mathbb{F}_p$ is exactly the field with $CharK=p$ and $p^n$ elements.

A finite field $K$ with $p^n$ elements has a subfield $K^{\prime}$  with $p^m$ elements iff $m$ is a divisor of $n$.

The additive group $K^*$ of a finite field $K$ is cyclic.

A finite field $K$ with $CharK=p$ is a simple extension ([[Field Extension#Simple Extension]]).

Any two finite fields with the same number of elements are isomorphic ([[Homomorphism#Monomorphisms Epimorphisms and Isomorphisms]])
