A [[Topological Space]] $X$ is called *Hausdorff* if for each $x,y\in X$, there are open neighborhoods $U_x$ and $U_y$ of $x$ and $y$ s.t. $U_x\cap U_y=\emptyset$. We say points in $X$ are *separable by open neighborhoods*.

Hausdorff spaces have the following properties:

* Given a [[Continous Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ with $Y$ Hausdorff, the graph ([[Function#Graphs]]) of $f$ is closed in $X\times Y$
* $X$ is Hausdorff iff the diagonal set $\Delta = \{(x,x)\in X\}$ is closed in $X\times X$.
