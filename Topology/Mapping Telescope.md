Let $X_0\xrightarrow{f_0}X_1\xrightarrow{f_1}X_2\rightarrow \dots$ be a sequence of [[Continous Function]]s. Then the *mapping telescope* $T$ of this sequence is the union of the mapping cylinders ([[Attaching Spaces#Mapping Cylinder]]) $M_{f_i}$ with the copies $X_i$ in $M_{f_i}$ and $M_{f_{i-1}}$ identified for all $i$.

It is the quotient space of the [[Disjoint Union]] $\bigsqcup_i (X_i\times [i,i+1])$ with each point $(x_i,i+1)\in X_i\times [i,i+1]$ identified with $(f_i(x_i),i+1)\in X_{i+1}\times [i+1,i+2]$. 
We write $T_i$ for the union of the first $i$ mapping cylinders in $T$.
