Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a [[Function]] between [[Topological Space]]s $X$ and $Y$, then

* $f$ is called *open*, if for any open set $U\subseteq X$, the image $f(U)$ is open in $Y$
* $f$ is called *closed* if for any closed set $C\subseteq X$, the image $f(C)$ is closed in $Y$.



### Closed Map Lemma

Any continous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ with $X$ compact ([[Compactness]]) and $Y$ a [[Hausdorff Space]] is closed and proper (preimages of compact sets are compact)
