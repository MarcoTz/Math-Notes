The *unit sphere* in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the ball ([[Metric Space]]) with radius 1 centered at the origin. It is denoted by $S^{n-1}$, so all pionts that are exactly distance 1 from the origin.
Since the dimension of $S^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $n$, we use $n$ as superscipt instead of $n+1$.

$S^n$ is a [[Topological Space]] with the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[Topological Space#Subspaces]], [[Metric Space]]).

The interior of $S^n$ ([[Topological Space#Interior]]) is the *unit disk*, denoted by $D^{n+1}$. Sometimes $D^{n+1}$ is used to denote $S^n\cup D^{n+1}$

### Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem

Every [[Continous Function]] $h:D^n \rightarrow D^n$ (here this is the closed unit disk) has at least one fixed point (i.e. $h(x)=x$) 

### Borsek-Ulam Theorem
For every continous map $f:S^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ there exists a map of antipodal points $x$ and $-x$ with $f(x)=f(-x$).

### Fundamental group and Homology groups 

For $S^n$ we have $\pi_1(S^n) = 0$ for $n>1$ and $\pi_1(S^1)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ ([[The Fundamental Group]]) generated by a loop going around the circle exactly once.
The singular homology groups ([[Singular Homology]]) of $S^n$ are $\tilde{H}_n(S^n)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $\tilde{H}_i(S^n)=0$ for $i\neq n$ ([[Homology#Reduced Homology]]).
More generally, for [[Homotopy Groups]] we have $\pi_n(S^k)=0$ for $n<k$.


### Degree

A [[Continous Function]] $f:S^n\rightarrow S^n$ induces a map $f_*:H_n(S^n)\rightarrow H_n(S^n)$ on [[Singular Homology]]. Since this group is $\mathbb{Z}$ , $f_*$ has the form $\alpha \mapsto d\alpha$ for some $d\in\mathbb{Z}$.
This $d$ is called the *degree* of $f$, denoted $degf$. We have 
1. $deg\mathbb{1}=1$
2. $degf=0$ if $f$ is not surjective.
3. $f\simeq g$ iff $deg(f)=deg(g)$  
4. $deg(fg)=deg(f)deg(g)$
5. If $f$ is a reflection $deg(f)=-1$
6. $deg(-\mathbb{1})=(-1)^n$  for the antipodal map $-\mathbb{1}$
7. If $f$ has no fixed points, $deg(f)=(-1)^{n+1}$

#### Local Degree 

If $f:S^n\rightarrow S^n$ is a map with the property that for some $y\in S^n$ $f^{-1}(y)=\{x_1,\dots,x_m\}$ is finite. Then let $U_1,\dots,U_m$ be disjoint neighborhoods of the $x_i$ mapped to a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ by $f$.
Then we can identify $H_n(U_i,U_i\setminus \{x_i\})$ and $H_n(V,V\setminus\{y\})$ with $H_n(S^n)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ ([[Homotopy#Relative Homotopy]]). and $f_*$ is a homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ on these groups. 
The degree of this $f_*$ is called the *local degree* of $f$ at $x_i$, written $degf|_{x_i}$
We have $deg f = \sum_i degf|_{x_i}$ 

### [[Cohomology Ring]]s

 $H^*(J(S^n);\mathbb{Z})$  consists of  $\mathbb{Z}$ in each dimension that is a multiple of $n$, where $J(S^n)$ is the [[James Reduced Product]] of $S^n$.
 If $n$ is even, the $i$-th power of a generator of $H^n(J(S^n);\mathbb{Z})$ is $i!$ times a generateor of $H^{in}(J(S^n);\mathbb{Z})$ for any $i\geq 1$.
 If $n$ is odd, $H^*(J(S^n);\mathbb{Z}) \cong H^*(S^n;\mathbb{Z})\otimes H^*(J(S^{2n};\mathbb{Z}))$ as [[Gradings]]s ([[Tensor Product]])
