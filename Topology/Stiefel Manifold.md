The *Stiefel Manifold* $V_{n,k}$ is the set of *orthonormal $k$-frames* in $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e. orthonormal $k$-tuples of vectors. 
It is a [[Topological Space]] with the induced subspace topology when considering it a subspace of $k$ copies of $S^{n-1}$.

$$V_{n,n} = O(n)$$ ([[Orthogonal Group]]) $$V_{n,1} = S^{n-1}$$
$V_{n,2}$ can be identified with the set of unit tangent vectors to $S^{n-1}$.
$V_{n,n-1}$ can be identified with $SO(n)$ ([[Special Orthogonal Group]])
