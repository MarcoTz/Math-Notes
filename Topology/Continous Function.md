A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ between [[Topological Space]]s $X$ and $Y$ is called *continous*, if for every open set $U\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.

Equivalently, the preimage of any closed set in $Y$ is closed in $X$.

 If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ takes a point $x_0\in X$ to $y_0 \in Y$, we sometimes write $f:(X,x_0)\rightarrow (Y,y_0)$.
 
Continous Functions are [[Homomorphism]]s on topological spaces.

### Homeomorhpism

A continuous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ with continuous inverse ([[Function#Inverses]]) is called a *homeomorphism*. In this case $X$ and $Y$ are called *homeomorphic*, written $X\cong Y$.

### Paths

A continous map $f:I\rightarrow X$ is called a *path*. $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are called the *endpoints* of the path.
A path $f:I\rightarrow X$ with $f(0)=f(1)$ is called a *loop*.
