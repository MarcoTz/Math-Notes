Let $X,E$ be [[Topological Space]]s and $p:E\rightarrow X$ a [[Continous Function]] s.t. each $p^{-1}(x)$ has a [[Group]] structure, all isomorphic to some fixed group $G$ in the following way. For each point $x\in X$, there is a neighborhood $U$ and a homeomorphism $h_U : p^{-1}(U) \rightarrow U\times G$ mapping $p^{-1}(x) to $\{x\}\times G$ by a group isomorphism. This is called a *bundle of groups* over $X$ with *fibers* $p^{-1}(x)$.

Finite sums $\sum_i n_i \sigma_i$ with $n_i$ being a lift of an $n$-simplex ([[Simplices]]) $\sigma_i$ form an abelian group $C_n(X;E)$ where where sums of lifts are pointwise. Via $\partial :C_n(X;E)\rightarrow C_{n-1}(X;E)$ $\sum_i n_i\sigma_i \mapsto \sum_{i,j} (-1)^j n_i\sigma_i |[v_n,\dots,\hat{v}_j,\dots,v_n]$  with $\partial^2=0$ makes these groups into a chain complex ([[Chain Complexes]]) with [[Homology]] groups $H_n(X;E)$.

If $X$ is path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]) with universal covering space, the groups $H_n(X;E)$ are naturally isomorphic to $H_n(X;G)$ with local coefficients in the $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$-module $G$ associated to $E$, where $\pi = \pi_1(X)$ ([[The Fundamental Group]], [[Homology with local coefficients]])
