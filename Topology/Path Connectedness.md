A [[Topological Space]] $X$ is *path-connected* if for each $x,y\in X$, there is a path ([[Continous Function#Paths]]) with endpoints $x$ and $y$, i.e. there is a path connecting $x$ and $y$. 
Any path-connected space is also connected ([[Connectedness]]).

If $X$ is not path-connected, we call maximum (ordered by inclusion) path-connected subsets of $X$ the path-components  of $X$.

### Local Path Connectedness

A topological space $X$ is said to be locally path-connected, if for each $x\in X$, there is a open neighborhood of $x$ that is path-connected.
If a space is connected and locally path-connected, it is path-connected.
