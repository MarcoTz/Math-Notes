The *cone* $CX$ of a [[Topological Space]] $X$ is the quotient space ([[Topology/Quotient Space]]) of $X\times \{x\} \times I$ with a point $x\notin X$ under the identification $(x_1,x,1)\sim (x,x,1)$.
Intuitively, this is the space obtained from $X$ by connecting every point in $X$ to an external point $x$ using line segments ($I$).

The cone $CX$ is a special case of a [[Join]]
