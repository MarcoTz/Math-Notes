A [[Topological Space]] $X$ is *quasi-compact*, if any of the following equivalent conditions hold.

* Every family of closed sets in $X$ with empty intersection contains a finite family with empty intersection
* every open covering of $X$ contains a finite open subcovering 

A quasi-compact space is compact ([[Compactness]]) if it is a [[Hausdorff Space]].
