A subset $Y\subseteq X$ of a [[Topological Space]] $X$ is called *irreducible*, if whenever $Y=Y_1\cup Y_2$ for two closed subsets $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ of $Y$, then $Y=Y_1$ or $Y=Y_2$.

If $X$ is not irreducible, then there is a unique decomposition $X = X_1\cup\dots\cup X_n$ (up to ordering of the $X_i$) s.t. all $X_i$ are irreducible. 
The $X_i$ are called *irreducible components* of $X$.
If $X$ is reducible and the dimension ([[Lebesgue Covering Dimension]]) of all irreducible components of $X$ is equal, $X$ is called *equidimensional*
