Given a [[Topological Space]] $X$ and an equvalence Relation ([[Relation#Equivalence Relations]]) $\sim$ on $X$, the *quotient space* of $X$ and $\sim$ , written $X/\sim$ is the set of equivalence classes $[x]$ of elements $x\in X$ under $\sim$.
The quotient space $X/\sim$ is given the *quotient topology*, generated by subsets $U\subseteq X/\sim$ s.t. the set $\{x\in X| [x]\in U\}\subseteq X$ is open in $X$.
Equivalently, open sets in $X/\sim$ are all sets for which the preimage ([[Function#Preimages]]) under the map $\varphi : X\rightarrow X/\sim \quad x\mapsto [x]$ are open. 

In particular, for a subset $A\subseteq X$, the relation $x\sim y \Leftrightarrow x\in A,y\in A$ is an equivalence relation and the quotient space $X/\sim$ is written $X/A$, which can be interpreted by replacing $A$ in $X$ by a point. 

This construction is similar to [[Topology/Quotient Space]].

### Quotient Maps

A [[Continous Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ that is surjective ([[Function#Injections Surjections and Bijections]]) is caleld a *quotient map*.
In this case $Y$ can be regarded as a subset of $X$ (identified with $f^{-1}(Y)$) and we can construct the quotient space $X/f^{-1}(Y)$ written as $X/Y$
