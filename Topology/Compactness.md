A subset $A$ of a [[Topological Space]] $X$ is called *compact*, if each open cover of $A$ ([[Topological Space#Covers]]) has a finite subcover (i.e. one with only finitely many elements).

For a topological space $X$, the following are equivalent

1. $X$ is compact
2. $X$ has a subbase ([[Topological Space#Basis]]) s.t. every cover of $X$ consisting of members of the subbase has a finite subcover
3. $X$ is a [[Lindel√∂f space]] and countably compact 
4. For every topological space $Y$, the projection $\pi X\times Y\rightarrow X$ is closed ([[Open and Closed Maps]])

### Countable Compactness 

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is called *countably compact* if evey countable ([[Natural numbers]]) cover of $A$ has a finite subcover
