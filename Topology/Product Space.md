The Cartesian Product ([[Sets#Cartesian Product]]) $X\times Y$ of two [[Topological Space]]s $X$ and $Y$ is a topological space, called the *Product space*, with the *product topology*, defined as the coarsest (i.e. with the fewest open sets) topology s.t. the canonical projections $\pi_X :X\times Y \rightarrow X$ and $\pi_Y : X\times Y \rightarrow Y$ are continous.

The topolgy of the product space is generated ([[Topological Space#Basis]]) by sets of the form $U\times Y=\pi_X^{-1}(U)$ and $X\times V=\pi_Y^{-1}(V)$ where $U\subseteq X$ and $V\subseteq Y$ are open sets.
