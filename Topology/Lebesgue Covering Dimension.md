The *topological dimension* or *Lebesgue covering dimension* of a [[Topological Space]] $X$ is defined as follows.

Given an open cover ([[Topological Space#Covers]]) $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $X$ the *order* or *ply* is the smallest $m$ (if it exists) s.t. each $x\in X$ is contained in at most $m$ sets $U_i$. In other words $U_{i_1}\cap \dots \cap U_{i_m} = \emptyset$ for distinct $i_1,\dots,i_m$.
Then the dimension of $X$ is the smallest number $n$, s.t. every open cover $\mathfrak{U}$ of $X$ has an open refinement $\mathfrak{B}$ with order $n+1$. If no such $n$ exists, we say $dimX =\infty$.
