The *orthogonal group* *O(n)* is the group of isometries ([[Isometry]]) of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Equivalently, $O(n)$ is the [[Group]] of $n\times n$-matrices $A$ ([[Matrix]]) over $\mathbb{R}$ s.t. $AA^t=\mathbb{1}$ ([[Matrix#Transpose of a matrix]]). WIth the induced subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ $O(n)$ is a [[Topological Space]]. Alternatively its topology can also be viewed as induced from $n$ copies of $S^{-1}$ since columns of orthogonal matrices are unit vectors.

$O(n)$ is a compact space. ([[Compactness]]), a [[Topological Group]] and thus a [[H-Space]].
Any orthogonal matrix has [[Determinant]] $\pm 1$ and the kernel of the determinant map (i.e. all orthogonal matrices with determinant $1$) is called the [[Special Orthogonal Group]].
