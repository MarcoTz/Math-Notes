The *row rank* of a $n\times m$ [[matrix]] A is defined as the maximum number of rows of $A$ that are linearly independent ([[Vector Space]]).

The *column rank* of $A$ is the maximun number of columns that are linearly independent.

For any matrix, the row and column ranks are always equal, and are just called the *rank* of $A$, denoted $rank(A)$ .
If $rank(A) = min(n,m)$ we say $A$ has full rank.
