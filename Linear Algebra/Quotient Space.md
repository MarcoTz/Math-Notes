Given a [[Vector Space]] $V$ and a subspace $N\subseteq V$, the *quotient space* $V/N$ is the set of equivalence classes ([[Relation#Equivalence Classes]]) of the equivalence relation $x\sim y \Leftrightarrow x-y\in N$ with vector space structure given by

* $\alpha [x] = [\alpha x] \forall \alpha \in K,[x]\in V/N$
* $[x]+[y] = [x+y] \forall [x],[y]\in V/N$

We often write $x+N$  for the equivalence class $[x]$.

This construction is similar to [[Topology/Quotient Space]]
