A $n$-dimensional *manifold*, is a [[Hausdorff Space]] $M$ s.t. for each $x\in M$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[Continous Function#Homeomorhpism]])

For a $n$-manifold $M$, the [[Homology]] groups $H_i(M,M\setminus\{x\};\mathbb{Z})$ for any $x\in M$ are all $0$, except when $i=n$.

If $M$ is compact ([[Compactness]]), it is called *closed*.

For a closed, connected ([[Connectedness]]) $n$-manifold, the torsion subgroup of $H_{n-1}(M;\mathbb{Z})$ is either trivial, if $M$ is orientable ([[Orientation]]) or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ otherwise.
Furthermore, for noncompact, connected $n$-manifolds $M$, $H_i(M;R) = 0$ for $i\geq n$
