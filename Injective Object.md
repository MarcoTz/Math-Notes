Let $\mathfrak{U}$ be an [[Abelian Category]]. Then an object $I$ of $\mathfrak{U}$ is called *injective* if the functor $Hom(\cdot,I)$ is exact ([[Exact Functor]]).

If every object of $\mathfrak{U}$ is isomorphic to some injective object of $\mathfrak{U}$, we say $\mathfrak{U}$ has *enough injectives*. 
If $\mathfrak{U}$ has enough injectives, every object has an [[Injective Resolution]].
