A *graph*, or sometimes *undirected graph* is a pair $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of with elements called *vertices* and $E$ is a subset of the set of two-element subsets of $V$, with elements called edges.

The vertices are interpreted as points while the edges are lines connecting the points.
In algebraic topology, graphs are [[Cell Complexes]] of dimension 1.

### Directed Graphs

A *directed graph* is the same as an undirected graph, but the edges are pairs in $V\times V$, so there is a first and second vertex for each edge.
