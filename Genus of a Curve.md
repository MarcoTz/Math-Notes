Let $X$ be a curve ([[Curve (Scheme)]]) over a [[Field]] $k$, then

$$ p_a(X) = p_g(X) = dim_k H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$$
where $p_a$ is the [[Arithmetic Genus]] and $p_g$ the [[Geometric Genus]] of $X$ (see also [[Cohomology Functor]]).
We call this number the *Genus* of $X$ and denote it by $g(X)$. 
If $g(X) = 1$ we say $X$ is an *elliptic curve*.
