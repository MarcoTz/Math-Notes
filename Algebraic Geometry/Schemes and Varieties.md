Let $k$ be a fixed algebraically closed [[Field]]. Then there is a natural fully faithful [[Functor]] $t:\mathfrak{Var(k)}\rightarrow\mathfrak{Sch}(k)$ from the [[Category]] of varieties ([[Variety]]) over $k$ to the category of [[Scheme]]s over $k$ ([[Scheme over a Scheme]]). 
For any variety $V$, $V$ and $Sp(t(V))$ are homeomorphic as [[Topological Space]]s and the [[Sheaf]] of [[Regular Function]]s on $V$ is the restruction of the structure sheaf of $t(V)$ under this homeomorphism.

### Affine Space 

The affine $n$-space over an algebraically closed field $k$ is defined as the affine scheme $\mathbb{A}^n_k = Spec k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Then the closed points of $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ are in $1-1$ correspondence with ordered $n$-tuples of elements in $k$. Furthermore, this set with its induced topology is homeomoephic to the [[Affine Space]] $\mathbb{A}^n$ as a variety. 

### Projective Space 

For a ring $A$, the projective $n$-space $\mathbb{P}^n_A$ is defined as $Proj A[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ ([[Projective Scheme]]). 
The subspace of closed points of $\mathbb{P}^n_A$ is homeomporphic to the [[Projective Space]] $\mathbb{P}^n_A$ as a variety. 

### Image of $t$

For an algebraically closed field $k$, the image of the functor $t:\mathfrak{Var}(k)\rightarrow \mathfrak{Sch}(k)$ is exactly the set of quasi-projective integral schemes over $k$ ([[Projective Variety]],[[Properties of Schemes]]). The image of the set of projective varieties is the set of projective integral schemes of finite type over $k$ ([[Finite Morphisms of Schemes]]).
