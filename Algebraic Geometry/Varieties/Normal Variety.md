A [[Variety]] $V$ is *normal* iff its coordinate ring is a [[Normal Ring]].

For any irreducible ([[Irreducible Sets]]) [[Affine Variety]] $V$ over $\mathbb{C}$, its *normalization* is the variety $V^{\prime} = Spec(\mathbb{C}[V]^{\prime})$ where $\mathbb{C}[V]^{\prime}=\{\alpha \in \mathbb{C}(V) : \alpha \text{ integral over } \mathbb{C}[V]\}$. 
$V^{\prime}$ is a normal variety.

Any smooth ([[Singularities]]) irreducible affine variety $V$ is normal
