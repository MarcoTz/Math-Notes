The following equivalent formulations are all referred to as *Hilbert's Nullstellensatz*

* Let $k$ be a [[Field]] with algebraic closure ([[Algebraic Field extension]]) $K$ and $f,f_1,\dots,f_m\in k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ ([[Polynomial Ring]]) with the [[Ideal]] $I$ generated by $f_1,\dots, f_m$. If every $a\in K^n$ with $f_1(a)=\dots = f_m(a)=0$ satisfies $f(a)=0$ then $f^r\in I$ for some $r>0$.
* Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and $a\subseteq K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ be an ideal (not equal to the whole ring), then there is some $x\in K^n$ with $f(x)=0$ for all $f\in a$.
* Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and $a\subseteq K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ an ideal. Then $\sqrt{a} = I(V(A))$ ([[Affine Variety]]), where $\sqrt{a} = \{f\in K[X_1,\dots,X_n] | f^n \in a$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}\}$
* Let $K$ be a field with maximal ideal $m\subseteq K[X_1,\dots,X_n]=:A$. Then the [[Field Extension]] $[A/m:K]$ is finite.
* Every prime ideal in $k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is the intersection of all maximal ideals containing it (for any field $k$)
* Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and $m$ a maximal ideal in $k[X_1,\dots, X_n]$. Then $m=(X_1-a_1,\dots, X_n-a_n)$ for some $(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in K^n$.
