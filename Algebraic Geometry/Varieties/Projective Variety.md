An irreducible algebraic set ([[Zariski Topology]], [[Irreducible Sets]]) in $\mathbb{P}^n$ ([[Projective Space]]) is called a *projective variety*.
An open subset of a projective variety is called *quasi-projective variety*.
The dimension of a (quasi-) projective variety is defined the same way as for an [[Affine Variety]].

The *homogeneous [[Ideal]]* of any subset $Y$ of $\mathbb{P}^n$ is the ideal generated by all homogeneous polynomials $f$ with $f(P)=0$ for all $P\in Y$.

Any (quasi-) projective variety $Y$ is covered by the open sets $Y\cap \{x_i\neq 0\}$ which are homeomorphic to (quasi-) affine varieties ([[Projective Space#Affine Covering]])


### Homogeneous Coordinate Ring 

The homogeneous coordinate ring of a projective variety $Y$ is defined as $K[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I(Y)$ 
We denote the coordinate ring of $Y$ by $S(Y)$.
