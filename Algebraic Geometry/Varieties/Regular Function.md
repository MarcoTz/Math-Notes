For an (quasi-)[[Affine Variety]] $Y\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ over a field $k$, a function $f:Y\rightarrow k$ is called *regular* at a point $P\in Y$ if there is some open neighborhood $U$ of $P$ and polynomials $g,h\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with $f=\frac{g}{h}$ on $U$ and $h\neq 0$ on $U$.
If $f$ is regular at every point of $Y$, we say $f$ is regular on $Y$.
For a (quasi-)[[Projective Variety]], regular functions are defined the same way, except that $f$ and $g$ need to be homogeneous and of the same degree.

For a variety $Y$, the [[Ring]] of all regular functions on $Y$ is denoted by $\mathcal{O}(Y)$.

Regular functions are continous in the [[Zariski Topology]]. 

For an [[Affine Variety]] $Y$ we have $\mathcal{O}(Y) \cong A(Y)$ where $A(Y)$ is the coordinate ring of $Y$.

For a [[Projective Variety]] $Y$ over $K$, $\mathcal{O}(Y)\cong $K$.
