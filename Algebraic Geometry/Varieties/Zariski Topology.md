In the [[Affine Space]] $\mathbb{A}^n$ over a field $k$, Zariski-closed sets, also called *algebraic sets*,  are sets of the form $Z(T)=\{P\in\mathbb{A}^n|f(P)=0\forall f\in T\}$ for some subset $T\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. This defines a topology on $\mathbb{A}^n$, called the *Zariski Topology*.

Similarly, for the [[Projective Space]] $\mathbb{P}^n$ over a field $k$, Zariski-closed sets or *algebraic sets* are of the form $Z(T)=\{P\in \mathbb{P}^n|f(P)=0 \forall f\in T\}$ for any set of homogeneous polynomials $T$ ([[Polynomial Ring#Graded Ring]]).

The Zariski Topology is noetherian ([[Noetherian Space]]), so every closed set in $\mathbb{A}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be expressed uniquely as a union of varieties ([[Affine Variety]]).
