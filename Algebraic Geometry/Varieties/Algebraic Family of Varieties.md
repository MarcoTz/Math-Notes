Let $k$ be an algebraically closed [[Field]], $f:X\rightarrow T$ a surjective map of varieties over $k$ ([[Variety]]) s.t we have the following for each $t\in T$ 
* $f^{-1}(t)$ is irreducible ([[Properties of Schemes]]) and $dim(f^{-1}(t)) = dimX - dim T$ 
* if $m_t\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{t,T}$ is the maximal ideal ([[Maximal Ideal]]) and $\zeta\in f^{-1}(t)$ the generic point, then $f^{\#}m_t$ generates the maximal ideal $m_{\zeta} \subseteq \mathcal{O}_{\zeta,X}$ 
Then we write $X_{(t)} = f^{-1}(t)$ with reduced induced structure and say the $X_{(t)}$ form an *algebraic family of varieties* parametrized by $T$. 

If $X_{(t)}$ is an algebraic family of normal varieties ([[Normal Ring]]) parametrized by a nonsingular ([[Singularities]]) curve ([[Curve (Scheme)]]) $T$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, then $X_{(t)}$ is a flat ([[Flat Morphism]]) family of schemes.
