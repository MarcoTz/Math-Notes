For a [[Variety]] and any $P\in Y$, the *local [[Ring]]* of $P$ on $Y$, $\mathcal{O}_{P,Y}$ consists of pairs $\langle U, f\rangle$, called *germs of [[Regular Function]]s* where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $P$ and $f$ is regular on $U$. Two pairs $\langle U,f \rangle$ and $\langle V,g\rangle$ are considered the same if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$.

$\mathcal{O}_{P,V}$ is a [[Local Ring]] whose [[Maximal Ideal]] is the set of all germs $\langle U,f\rangle$ with $f(P)=0$.

For an affine variety $Y$, and any $P\in Y$, we have $\mathcal{O}_P \cong A(Y)_{m_p}$ and $dim(\mathcal{O}_P) = dim(Y)$ where $A(Y)_{m_P}$ denotes the [[Localization]] of $A(Y)$ with the maximal ideal $m_P$ containing all functions vanishing at $P$, and $dim(\mathcal{O}_P)$ is the Krull dimension ([[Ring#Krull Dimension]]).

For a [[Projective Variety]] $Y$ and a point $P\in Y$, let $m_P$ be the ideal generated bt the homogeneous functions $f\in S(Y)$ with $f(P)=0$.
Then $\mathcal{O}_P = S(Y)_{m_P}$
