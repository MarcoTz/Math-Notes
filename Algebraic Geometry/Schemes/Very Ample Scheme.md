Let $X$ be a [[Scheme]] over $Y$ ([[Scheme over a Scheme]]) and $\mathcal{L}$ an invertible shceaf on $X$ ([[Free Module of Scheaves]]). Then $\mathcal{L}$ is *very ample* relative to $Y$ if there is an immersion $i:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^r_Y$ for some $r$ with $i^*(\mathcal{O}(1)) \cong \mathcal{L}$ ($i$ is an immersion if it gives an isomorphism between $X$ and some open or closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^r_Y$ ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]])).

If $X$ is a projective scheme over $Y$ ([[Projective Scheme]]) it is proper ([[Proper Morphism]]) and there exists a very ample sheaf  on $X$ relative to $Y$.
