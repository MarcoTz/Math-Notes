Let $X$ be a [[Scheme]], $x\in X$. Then $x$ is an *associated point of $X$* if the maximal [[Ideal]] $m_x$ in the [[Local Ring]] $\mathcal{O}_{x,X}$ is an associated prime of $0$ or in other words, every element of $m_x$ is a zero divisor ([[Ring#Zero Divisors]]).

If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of schemes with $Y$ integral and regular of dimension $1$ ([[Properties of Schemes]]). Then $f$ is flat ([[Flat Morphism]]) iff every associated point of $x\in X$ maps to the generic point of $Y$.
If $X$ is reduced then every irreducible component of $X$ dominates $Y$.
