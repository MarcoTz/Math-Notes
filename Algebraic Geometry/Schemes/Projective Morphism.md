A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of [[Scheme]]s is *projective*, if it factors into a closed immersion ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) $i:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_Y$ for some $n$ followed by the projection $\mathbb{P}^n_Y \rightarrow Y$. 
A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of schemes is *quasi-projective* if it factors into an open immersion $j:X\rightarrow X^{\prime}$ followed by a projective morphism. 

A projective morphism of [[Noetherian Scheme]]s is a [[Proper Morphism]]. A quasi-projective morphism of noetherian schemes is of finite type ([[Finite Morphisms of Schemes]]) and separated ([[Separated Morphisms]]).
