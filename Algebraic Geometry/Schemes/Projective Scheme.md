Let $S=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0} S_d$ be a [[Gradings]], with the [[Ideal]] $S_+ =  \bigoplus_{d>0}S_d$. 
Then $ProjS$ is the set of all homogeneous [[Prime Ideal]]s not containing $S_+$.
For any homogeneous ideal $a$ we define $V(a) = \{p\in ProjS | a \subseteq p\}$. This has the following properties 

* $V(ab) = V(a)\cup V(b)$ for any two homogeneous ideals $a$ and $b$.
* For a family of homogeneous ideals $\{a_i\}$ wehave $V(\sum_i a_i) = \bigcup_i V(a_i)$

By taking all subsets of the form $V(a)$ to be closed, this defines a topology [[Topological Space]] on $ProjS$. 

We will write $S_{(p)}$ to be the set of elements with degree $0$ in $T^{-1}S$ where $T$ is the multiplicative system of all homogeneous elements of $S$ not in $p$ ([[Localization]]). Then we define a [[Sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}$ on $ProjS$ by taking $\mathcal{O}(U)$ to be the set of all functions $s:U\rightarrow \bigsqcup S_{(p)}$ s.t. $s(p)\in S_{(p)}$ for each $p$ in $U$. This is a sheaf with the natural restriction maps. 

Then the *projective scheme* of $S$ is $(Proj S,\mathcal{O})$. (compare [[Spectrum]]). We write $D_+(f) = \{p\in Poj S | f\notin p\}$ for any $f\in S$. This is a [[Scheme]] with the following properties

* $\mathcal{O}_P \cong S_{(p)}$ for all $p\in Proj S$
* $D_+(f)$ is open in $ProjS$ and these open sets cover $ProjS$.
* We have an isomorphism $(D_+(f),\mathcal{O}_{D_+(f)}) \cong Spec S_{(f)}$  

The projective $n$-space over a scheme $Y$, denoted $\mathbb{P}^n_Y$, is defined as the scheme $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}} \times_{Spec\mathbb{Z}} Y$ ([[Fibred Product]]), where $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}=Proj\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ ([[Schemes and Varieties]]).
A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of schemes is *projective*, if it factors into a closed immersion ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) $i:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_Y$ for some $n$ followed by the projection $\mathbb{P}^n_Y \rightarrow Y$ (see [[Projective Morphism]]). 
A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of schemes is *quasi-projective* if it factors into an open immersion $j:X\rightarrow X^{\prime}$ followed by a projective morphism. 

For a closed subscheme $Y\subseteq \mathbb{P}^r_A$ there is a homogeneous ideal $I\subseteq S = A[x_0,\dots,x_r]$ s.t. $Y$ is determined by $I$.
Any scheme $Y$ over $Spec A$ is projective iff it is isomorphic to $Proj S$ for some graded ring $S$ with $S_0=A$ and $S$ is finitely generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0$-algebra ([[Algebra]]).

Let $k$ be a [[Field]], $A$ a finitely generated $k$-algebra ([[Algebra]]), $X$ a projective scheme over $A$ and $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]). Then $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})$ is a finitely generated $A$-module ([[Module]]). In particular, if $A=k$, then $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})$ is a finite-dimensional $k$-vector space ([[Vector Space]]).
