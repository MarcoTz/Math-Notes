Let $X$ be a [[Noetherian Scheme]] and $Y$ a closed subscheme ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]). Then the *formal completion of $X$ along $Y$* is the [[Ringed Space]] $(\hat{X},\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}})$ where $\hat{X} = Y$ and $\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}}=\underleftarrow{\lim}\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}}/\mathcal{I}^n$ with $\mathcal{I}$the [[Sheaf of Ideals]] corresponding to $Y$. (see [[Completion of a Ring]])
