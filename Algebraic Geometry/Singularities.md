Let $A$ be an [[Affine Variety]] with $I(A)$ generated by $f_1,\dots, f_r$ and $P\in A$. If the [[Matrix]] $(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(P))_{ij}$ ([[Polynomial Ring#Derivative]]), called *Jacobian matrix*, has [[Rank]] $n-r$ where $n=dim Y$, $P$ is called *nonsingular point*. If all points of $Y$ are nonsingular, $Y$ is called *nonsingular*.
If this matrix has lesser rank, the point  $P$ is called *singular*. If $Y$ has any singular points, $Y$ is called *singular*.

$A$ is nonsingular at $P$ iff the local ring ([[Local Rings]]) $\mathcal{O}_{P,Y}$ is a regular local ring ([[Local Ring#Regular Local Ring]]).

For any variety $Y$, $P$ is a nonsingular point if $\mathcal{O}_{P,Y}$ is a regular local ring. $Y$ is nonsingular if it is nonsingular at every point. 
Otherwise $P$ is called *singular*, and $Y$ is called *singular* if it has singular points.

The set $Sing(Y)$ of singular points of $Y$ is a proper closed subset of $Y$.
