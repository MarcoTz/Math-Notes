A [[Scheme]] is *connected* if its [[Topological Space]] is connected.

A scheme is *irreducible*, if its topological space is irreducible ([[Irreducible Sets]]).

A scheme $X$ is *reduced*, if for every open set $U$, the [[ring]] $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ has no nilpotent elements ([[Ring#Zero Divisors]]).

A scheme $X$ is *integral* if for every open set $U$, the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ is an [[Integral Domain]].
A scheme is integrall iff it is reduced and irreducible.
