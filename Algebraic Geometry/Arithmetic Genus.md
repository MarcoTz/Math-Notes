Let $X$ be a [[Projective Scheme]] over a [[Field]] $k$, s.t. all irreducible components ([[Irreducible Sets]]) of $X$ have dimension $n$.
Then the *arithmetic genus* $p_a(X)$ is defined as 

$$ p_a(X) = (-1)^n(\chi(X,\mathcal{O}_X)-1) $$ where $\chi$ denotes the [[Euler Characteristic]] of the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$.
Equivalently, we have 
$$ p_a(X) = 1-P_X(0)$$ where $P_X$ is the [[Hilbert Polynomial]] of $X$.

$p_a$ is invariant under birational equivalences ([[Birational Map]])
