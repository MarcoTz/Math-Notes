A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of [[scheme]]s is *locally of finite type* if there is a covering of $Y$ by open affine subsets ([[Spectrum]]) $V_i=SpecB_i$ s.t. for each $i$, $f^{-1}(V_i)$ can be covered by open affine subsets $U_{ij}=SpecA_{ij}$ where each $A_{ij}$ is a finitely generated $B$-[[Algebra]].
$f$ is of *finite type*, if each $f^{-1}(V_i)$ can be covered by only finitely many such $U_{ij}$.

A morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a *finite morphism* if there is a covering of $Y$ by open affine subsets $V_i=SpecB_i$ s.t. for each $i$, each $f^{-1}(V_i)=SpecA_i$ is affine, where $A_i$ is a $B_i$-algebra, which is a finitely generated $B_i$-[[Module]].
