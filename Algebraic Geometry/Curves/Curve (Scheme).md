A *curve* over an algebraically closed [[Field]] $k$ is an integral separated [[Scheme]] $X$ of finite type over $k$ ([[Scheme over a Scheme]],[[Properties of Schemes]]) of dimension one.
If $X$ is proper over $k$ ([[Proper Morphism]]), we say $X$ is *complete* and if all local rings of $X$ are regular, $X$ is *nonsingular*.

For nonsingular curves over $k$ with function field $K$ we have the following equivalences
* $X$ is projective 
* $X$ is complete 
* $X\cong t(C_K)$ where $t$ is the functor from varieties to schemes ([[Schemes and Varieties]]) and $C_K$ is the unique curve (as a [[Variety]]) determined by $K$

If $X$ is a complete nonsingular curve over $k$ and $Y$ is any curve over $k$ with a morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$, then either $f(X)$ is a point or $f(X)=Y$ and $K(X)$ is a finite extension field ([[Field Extension]]) of $K(Y)$, $f$ is finite ([[Finite Morphisms of Schemes]]) and $Y$ is also complete.
