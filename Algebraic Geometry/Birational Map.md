A *birational map* $\varphi : X \rightarrow Y$ between two varieties ([[Variety]]) is a [[Rational Map]] s.t. there is a rational map $\psi : X\rightarrow Y$ with $\psi\circ \varphi = \mathbb{1}_X$ and $\varphi \circ \psi = \mathbb{1}_Y$.

If there is a birational map between varieties $X$ and $Y$, they are called *birationally equivalent* or just *birational*.
