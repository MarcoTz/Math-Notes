Let $S$ be a [[Gradings]] and $M$ a graded $S$-[[Module]]. Then the *sheaf associated to $M$* on $Proj S$ ([[Projective Scheme]]), denoted $\tilde{M}$ is defined as follows. 
For $p\in ProjS$, let $M_{(p)}$ be the [[Group]] of elements of degree $0$ in $T^{-1}M$ ([[Localization]]), where $T$ is the multiplicative system of homogeneous elements of $S$ not in $p$. For an open set $U\subseteq ProjS$, we then define $\tilde{M}(U)$ to be the set of functions $s \rightarrow \bigsqcup_{p\in U} M_{(p)}$ s.t. for every $p\in U$ there is a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ in $U$ and homogeneous elements $m\in M$ and $f\in S$ of the same degree, s.t. for $q\in V$ we have $f\notin q$ and $s(q) = \frac{m}{f}\in M_{(p)}$. 
With the obvious restriction maps, $\tilde{M}$ defines a [[Sheaf]].

For a graded ring $S$ and graded $S$-module $M$ and $X=ProjS$ we have 
* $(\tilde{M})_p = M_{(p)}$ 
* For $f\in S_+$ homogeneous, $\tilde{M}|_{D_+(f)} \cong (M_{(f)})\tilde{}$ 
* $M$ is a quasi-coherent ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) $\mathcal{O}_X$-module, which is coherent if $S$ is noetherian and $M$ finitely generated
