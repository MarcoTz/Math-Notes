Let $X$ be a nonsingular ([[Singularities]]) [[Variety]] over a [[Field]] $k$. Then the *canonical sheaf* ([[Sheaf]]) of $X$ is $\omega_X = \bigwedge^n \Omega_{X/k}$ ([[Sheaf of relative differentials]],[[Tensor Operations on Sheaves]]) where $n=dim(X)$. 
A divisor $K$ s.t. $\omega_X$ is the associated sheaf to $K$ is called a *canonical divisor*. 
If $K$ and $K^{\prime}$ are canonical divisors, then $K\sim K^{\prime}$, so we sometimes also call $K$ the *canonical class* referring to its linear equivalence class ([[Linear Equivalence]]).
