An invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ ([[Free Scheaf of Modules]]) on a [[Noetherian Scheme]] $X$ is called *ample* if for every coherent sheaf ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, there is some $n_0 > 0$ s.t. $\mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{L}^n$ is generated by global sections ([[Generated By Global Sections]]) for any $n>n_0$ ($\mathcal{L}^n = \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$ 

For an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$, the following are equivalent 
* $\mathcal{L}$ is ample
* $\mathcal{L}^m$ is ample for all $m>0$ 
* $\mathcal{L}^m$ is ample for some $m>0$ 

If $X$ is of finite type over a [[Noetherian Ring]] $A$ ([[Finite Morphisms of Schemes]]), this is equivalent to $\mathcal{L}^m$ to be very ampe ([[Very Ample Scheme]]) for some $m>0$. 

For $A$ [[Noetherian Ring]] and $X$ proper scheme over $Spec A$ ([[Proper Morphism]],[[Scheme over a Scheme]]), let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertivle sheaf on $X$ ([[Free Scheaf of Modules]]). Then the following are equivalent 
* $\mathcal{L}$ is ample
* for each coherent sheaf ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, there is some $n_0$ s.t. for each $i>0$ and $n\geq n_0$, $H^i(X,\mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{L}^n) = 0$
