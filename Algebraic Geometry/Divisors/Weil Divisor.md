Let $X$ is a noetherian ([[Noetherian Scheme]]), integral ([[Properties of Schemes]]) [[Scheme]] that is regular in codimension one, i.e. every [[Local Ring]] $\mathcal{O}_x$ of $X$ of dimension one is regular.
Then a *prime divisor* on $X$ is a closed integral subscheme ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) $Y$ of codimension one and $Div(X)$ is the free group ([[Free Groups]]) generated by prime divisors of $X$. Elements of $Div(X)$ are called *Weil Divisors*.
We write $D = \sum n_i Y_i$ for a Weil divisor, where $Y_i$ are prime divisors and $n_i\in \mathbb{Z}$.
If all $n_i\geq 0$ we say $D$ is *effective*.
