A *Cartier Divisor* on a [[scheme]] $X$ is a global section of the sheaf $\mathcal{K}^*/\mathcal{O}^*$ ([[Total Quotient Ring]],[[Sheaf]]).
By the properties of quotient schemes, a Cartier Divisor can be described b an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $X$ and $f_i\in\Gamma(U_i,\mathcal{K}^*)$ for each $i$, s.t. $\frac{f_i}{f_j}\in \Gamma(U_i\cap U_j,\mathcal{O}^*)$ for each $i,j$ (i.e. $f_i/f_j$ is invertible).

A Cartier Divisor is *principal* (see [[Principal Divisor]]) if it is in the image of the natural map $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{K}^*)\rightarrow \Gamma(X,\mathcal{K}^*/\mathcal{O}^*)$ .
Two Cartier Divisors are *linearly equivalent* ([[Linear Equivalence]]) if their difference is principal.

On a integral ([[Properties of Schemes]]), separated ([[Separated Morphisms]]), noetherian ([[Noetherian Scheme]]) scheme $X$ where all local rings are UFDs ([[Factorial Ring]]), the group $DivX$ of [[Weil Divisor]]s on $X$ is isomorphic to the group of Cartier Divisors $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{K}^*/\mathcal{O}^*)$, and principal divisors correspond to principal divisors under this isomorphism.
