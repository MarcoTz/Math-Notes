On a nonsingular ([[Singularities]]) projective variety $X$ ([[Projective Variety]]) ([[Schemes and Varieties]]), a *complete linear system* is the set of all effective divisors ([[Effective Divisor]]) linearly equivalent to some divisor $D_0$, written $|D_0|$ ([[Cartier Divisor]],[[Weil Divisor]]).
The set $|D_0|$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set $(\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})\setminus\{0\})/k^*$, so $|D_0|$  has the structure of the set of closed points of a projective space over $k$ ([[Projective Space]])

A *linear sytem* $\mathfrak{d}$ on $X$ is a subset of a complete linear system $|D_0|$ that is a linear subspace for the projective space structure of $|D_0|$. In other words, $\mathfrak{d}$ corresponds to a vector space $V\subseteq \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$ where $V=\{s\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L}) | (s)_0 \in \mathfrak{d}\} \cup \{0\}$ ($(s)_0$ is the [[Divisor of Zeros]]) .
We have $dim\mathfrak{d}=dimV-1$

### Base Points

A point $P\in X$ is called a *base point* of a linear system $\mathfrak{d}$ if $P\in SuppD$ for all $D\in\mathfrak{d}$ where $SuppD$ is the union of all prime divisors of $D$.
If $\mathfrak{d}$ corresponds to the subspace $V\subseteq \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$, a point $P\in X$ is a base-point of $\mathfrak{d}$ iff $\mathcal{L}$ is generated by the global sections in $V$ ([[Generated By Global Sections]])

### Trace

Let $i:Y\hookrightarrow X$ be a closed immersion ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) of nonsingular projective varieties over $k$, $\mathfrak{d}$ a linear system on $X$. Then the *trace* of $\mathfrak{d}$ on $Y$ is defined as follows.
$\mathfrak{d}$ corresponds to an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$ and vector space $V\subseteq \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$. Then $i^*\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}\otimes \mathcal{O}_Y$ is an invertible sheaf on $Y$ and a natural map $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow \Gamma(Y,i^*\mathcal{L})$. Then $\mathfrak{d}|_Y$ is the linear system defined by $i^*\mathcal{L}$ and the image of $V$ under the natural map.
