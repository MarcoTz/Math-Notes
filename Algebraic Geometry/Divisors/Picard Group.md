If $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are invertible sheaves ([[Free Scheaf of Modules]]), then $\mathcal{L}\otimes \mathcal{M}$ is as well, and there is an invertible scheaf $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$ on $X$ with $\mathcal{L}\otimes \mathcal{L}^{-1} \cong \mathcal{O}_X$, i.e. isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves form a group under $\otimes$.
This group is called the *Picard group* $PicX$ of $X$.
