If $Y$ is a prime divisor ([[Weil Divisor]]) on $X$ with generic point $\nu \in Y$. Then $\mathcal{O}_{\nu,X}$ is a [[Valuation Ring]] with [[Quotient Field]] $K$, the function field of $X$. The valuation $v_Y$ is called the *valuation of $Y$*. 
For $f\in K^*$ with $v_Y(f)>0$ we say $f$ has a *zero* of order $v(f)$ along $Y$ and if $v_Y(f) <0$ we say $f$ has a *pole of order $-v_Y(f)$* along $Y$.
In this case $v_Y(f)\neq 0$ for only finitely many $Y$ (with $f$ fixed), so we can define the following

For $f\in K^*$ the *divisor of f* is defined to be 
$$(f) = \sum v_Y(f) Y$$ where the sum goes over all prime divisors $Y$. Any divisor that is equal to the divisor of some $f$ is called *principal divisor*.

The mapping $f\mapsto (f)$ gives a group homomorphism between $K^*$ and $Div(X)$.
