Let $X$ be a nonsingular projective variety ([[Projective Variety]],[[Singularities]],[[Schemes and Varieties]]) over an algebraically closed [[Field]] $k$. Then [[Weil Divisor]]s and [[Cartier Divisor]]s are equivalent and there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear equivalence classes ([[Linear Equivalence]]) of divisors and isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves $\mathcal{L}$ ([[Free Scheaf of Modules]]).
For an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ and a nonzero section $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$ , the *divisor of zeros* $D=(s)_0$ of $s$ is defined as follows. 
For any open $U\subseteq X$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is trivial  we have an isomorphism $\varphi : \mathcal{L}|_U\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_U$ and $\varphi(s)\in\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_U)$. Then for an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of such open sets of $X$, $\{U,\varphi(s)\}$ defines a well-defined effective ([[Effective Divisor]]) Cartier divisor on $X$.

If $D_0$ is a divisor on $X$ and $\mathcal{L}$ the corresponding invertible sheaf, we have 
* for each nonzero $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L}): (s)_0\sim D$ 
* for every $D$ with $D\sim D_0$ there is some $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$ with $(s)_0=D$
* for $s,s^{\prime}\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$, $(s)_0=(s^{\prime})_0$ iff $s^{\prime} = \lambda s$ for some $\lambda \in k^*$
