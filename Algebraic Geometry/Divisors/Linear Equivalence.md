Two [[Weil Divisor]]s $D$ and $D^{\prime}$ are *linearly equivalent*, writted $D\sim D^{\prime}$ if $D-D^{\prime}$ is a [[Principal Divisor]]. The group $Cl(X) = Div(X)/\sim$ is called the *divisor class group* of $X$.

A [[Noetherian Ring]] $A$ is a UFD ([[Factorial Ring]]) iff $X=Spec A$ ([[Spectrum]]) is normal and $ClX=0$
