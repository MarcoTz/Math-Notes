Let $X$ be a [[Scheme]], $U=Spec A$ an affine subset of $X$ ([[Spectrum]]) and $S$ all elements of $A$ that are not zero divisors ([[Ring#Zero Divisors]]). Then let $K(U) = AS^{-1}$. This is called the *total quotient ring of $A$*.
Next, let $S(U)$ be the subset of $\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X)$ containing all elements that are not zero divisors in any local ring $\mathcal{O}_x$ with $x\in U$.
The sheaf $\mathcal{K}$ associated to the presheaf $U\mapsto S(U)^{-1}\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X)$ ([[Associated Sheaf]]) is called the *sheaf of total quotient rings of $\mathcal{O}$.

We denote the sheaf of invertible elements in $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{O}$ by $\mathcal{K}^*$ and $\mathcal{O}^*$ respectively.
