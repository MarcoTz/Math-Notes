Let $S$ be a [[Graded Ring]] and $X=ProjS$ ([[Projective Scheme]]). Then for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, the *twisting sheaf of Serre*, $\mathcal{O}_X(n)$ is the [[sheaf]]  $S(n)\tilde{}$ (elements of $S$  with degree at least $n$ and valuation of $S$ -n). 
For an arbitrary sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules $\mathcal{F}$, the *twisted sheaf* $\mathcal{F}(n)$ is defined as $\mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{O}_X(n)$ 

If $S$ is generated by $S_1$ as a $S_0$-algebra, we have the following
* $\mathcal{O}_X(n)$ is an invertible sheaf ([[Free Module of Scheaves]])
* For any graded $S$-module $M$, $\tilde{M}(n) \cong (M(n))\tilde{}$ . In particular $\mathcal{O}_X(n) \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(m) \cong \mathcal{O}_X(n+m)$
* If $T$ is another graded ring that is generated by $T_1$ as $T_0$-algebra, $\varphi:S\rightarrow T$ is a degree-preserving homomorphism, $U\subseteq Y=ProjT$ and $f:U\rightarrow X$ the morphism determined by $\varphi$, then $f^*(\mathcal{O}_X(n))\cong \mathcal{O}_Y(n)|_U$ and $f_*(\mathcal{O}(n)|_U) \cong (f_*\mathcal{O}_U(n))$ 

On an arbitrary scheme $Y$ ([[Scheme]]), the *twisting sheaf* $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^r_Y$ is defined as $g^*(\mathcal{O}(1))$ where $g:\mathbb{P}^r_Y \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^r_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the natural map (since $\mathbb{P}^n_Y = \mathbb{P}^r_{\mathbb{Z}}\times_{\mathbb{Z}} Y$). This coincides with the previous definition if $Y$ is affine.

By Serre's theorem ([[Generated By Global Sections#Serre's Theorem]]), for a projective scheme $X$ over a [[Noetherian Ring]] $A$, any coherent sheaf ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ can be written as the quotient of a sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ where $\mathcal{E}$ is a finite direct sum of twisted structure sheaves $\mathcal{O}(n_i)$ for some $n_i$.
