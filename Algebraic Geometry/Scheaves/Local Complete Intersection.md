Let $Y$ bew  a closed subscheme ([[Scheme]],[[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) of a nonsingular [[Variety]] $X$ over a [[Field]] $k$. Then $Y$ is a *local complete intersection* in $X$ if the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_Y$ ([[Sheaf of Ideals]]) of $Y$ in $X$ can be locally generated by $r=codim(Y,X)$ elements at every point.

For a locally complete intersection subscheme $Y$ we have 
* $Y$ is Cohen-Macaulay (i.e. all local rings are [[Cohen-Macaulay Ring]]s)
* $Y$ is normal iff it is regular in codimension $1$
