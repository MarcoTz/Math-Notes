A sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules ([[Sheaf of Modules]]) $\mathcal{F}$ is aclled *free*, if it is isomorphic to the direct sum of copies of $\mathcal{O}_X$.
It is *locally free* if $X$ can be covered by open sets $U$ s.t. $\mathcal{F}|_U$ is a free $\mathcal{O}_X|_U$-module.
The *rank* of a locally free module on an open set $U$ is the number of copies of the structure sheaf needed. 

A locally free sheaf of rank 1 is called an *invertible sheaf*.
