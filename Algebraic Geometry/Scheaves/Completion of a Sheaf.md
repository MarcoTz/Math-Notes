Let $X$ be a [[Noetherian Scheme]], $Y$ a closed subscheme ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) with corresponding [[Sheaf of Ideals]] $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{F} a coherent sheaf ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]). Then the *completion of $\mathcal{F}$ along $Y$*, denoted $\hat{\mathcal{F}}$ is the sheaf $\underleftarrow{\lim} \mathcal{F}/\mathcal{I}^n\mathcal{F}$ on $Y$. This is a natural $\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}}$ ([[Completion of a Scheme]])
