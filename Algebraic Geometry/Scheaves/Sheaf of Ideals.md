A *[[Sheaf]] of [[Ideal]]s* on $X$ is a [[Sheaf of Modules]] $\mathcal{I}$ that is a subsheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$.

For a closed subscheme ([[Open and Closed Subschemes]]) $Y$ of $X$ with inclusion $i:Y\rightarrow X$, the *ideal sheaf of Y*, denoted $\mathcal{I}_Y$ is the kernel ([[Sheaf Morphisms]]) of the morphism $i^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow i_*\mathcal{O}_Y$. 
This is a quasi-coherent ([[Coherent Sheaf of modules]]) sheaf of ideals on $X$. It is coherent if $X$ is noetherian.
Conversely, any quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals on $X$ is the ideal sheaf of a uniquely determined closed subscheme of $X$.
