For a [[Variety]] $Y$ over a [[Field]] $K$, the *function field* $K(Y)$ is the set of equivalence classes of pairs $\langle U,f\rangle$ where $U$ is a nonempty subset of $Y$, $f$ is a regular function on $U$ and two pairs $\langle U,f\rangle$ and $\langle V,g\rangle$ are equal, if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$. Elements of $K(Y)$ are called *rational functions* on $Y$.
Multiplication and addition on $K(Y)$ is defined pointwise.
Function fields of isomorphic varieties are isomorphic.

By restriction we get natural maps $\mathcal{O}(Y)\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_P \rightarrow K(Y)$, so we will consider the [[Local Rings]] and the ring of regular functions as subrings of $K(Y)$.

For an [[Affine Variety]] $Y$, $K(Y)$ is isomorphic to the [[Quotient Field]] of $A(Y)$, so the [[Transcendence Degree]] of $K(Y)$ as a [[Field Extension]] of $K$ is $dim(Y)$.

For a [[Projective Variety]] $Y$, $K(Y)\cong S(Y)_{(0)}$.
