Let $L\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^s$ be a sublattice ([[Lattice]]). Then $I_L = \langle x^{\alpha} - x^{\beta} | \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}^s, \alpha-\beta \in L\rangle$ is called a *lattice ideal*.
A prime lattice ideal is called a *toric ideal* ([[Prime Ideal]]).

An ideal $I\subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_s]$ is toric iff it is prime and generated by binomials.
