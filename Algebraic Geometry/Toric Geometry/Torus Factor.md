Let $X_{\Sigma}$ be a [[Toric Variety]]. Then $X_{\Sigma}$ has a *torus factor* if it is equivariantly isomorphic to the product of a nontrivial torus ([[Algebraic Torus]]) and a toric variety of smaller dimension.

The following are equivalent 
* $X_{\Sigma}$ has a torus factor 
* There is a nonconstant morphism $X_{\Sigma} \rightarrow\mathbb{C}^*$ 
* The $u_{\rho}$, $\rho\in\Sigma(1)$ do not span $N_{\mathbb{R}}$ ($u_{\rho}$ is the minimal generator of $\rho$)
