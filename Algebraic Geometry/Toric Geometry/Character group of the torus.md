A *character* of the torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ ([[Algebraic Torus]]) is a morphism $\chi: \mathbb{T}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^*$ that is also a group homomorphism.
For $m = (a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$, there is a character $\chi^m : \mathbb{T}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^*$ defined by $\chi^m(t_1,\dots,t_n) = t_1^{a_1}\dots t_n^{a_n}$.
All characters of $\mathbb{T}^n$ have the form $\chi^m$ for $m\in \mathbb{Z}^n$.

The set $M$ of all characters of a torus $T$ forms an algebraic group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$.
