The $n$-dimensional *algebraic torus* $\mathbb{T}^n$ is the affine open subset ([[Zariski Topology]],[[Affine Space]]) $\mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}^n \setminus V(x_1\dots x_n) \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$.
Its coordinate ring is $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{x_1\dots x_n} = \mathbb{C}[x_1^{\pm 1},\dots, x_n^{\pm 1}]$, the ring of *Laurent polynomials* ([[Localization]]).

$\mathbb{T}^n$ is a group under component-wise multiplication.
Any [[Affine Variety]] isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ is also called an algebraic torus.

If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two tori and $\Phi : T_1\rightarrow T_2$ is a morphism that is also a group homomorphism, then $\Phi(T_1)$ is a closed torus in $T_2$
If $T$ is a torus and $H\subseteq T$ a irreducible ([[Irreducible Sets]]) subvariety of $T$ that is also a subgroup, then $H$ is also a torus.

Since we have $T\simeq N\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{C}^*$ ([[One-Parameter Subgroup]],[[Natural Pairing of a Torus]]), we sometimes write $T_N$ for a torus with group of one-parameter subgroups $N$.
