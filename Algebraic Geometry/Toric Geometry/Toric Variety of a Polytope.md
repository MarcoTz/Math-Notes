Let $P\subseteq M_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a full-dimensional [[Lattice]] [[Polytope]]. Then the *toric variety* of $P$ is $X_P = X_{(kP)\cap M}$ ([[Projective Toric Variety]]) where $k\in\mathbb{N}$ s.t. $kP$ is very ample ([[Very Ample Polytope]]).
$X_P$ is a [[Normal Variety]].
if $kP$ is normal, then $X_P$ is a [[Projectively Normal Variety]]

The following are equivalent 
* $X_P$ is a smooth projective variety ([[Singularities]])
* $\Sigma_P$ is a smooth fan i.e. every cone in $\Sigma_P$ is smooth ([[Normal Fan]],[[Smooth cone]])
* $P$ is a [[Smooth Polytope]]

If $P_1\subseteq M_{1\mathbb{R}}$ and $P_1\subseteq M_{2\mathbb{R}}$ are two very ample polytopes, then
* $P_1 \times P_2 \subseteq (M_1 \times M_2)_{\mathbb{R}}$ is very ample and $(P_1\times P_2) \cap (M_1\times M_2) = (P_1\cap M_1) \times (P_2\cap M_2)$ 
* The image of $X_{P_1\times P_2} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{s-1}$ with $s = |(P_1\times P_2)\cap (M_1\times M_2)|$ is determined by $P_1\times P_2$ and is equal the image of $X_{P_1} \times X_{P_2} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{s-1}$ 
* $X_{P_1\times P_2} \cong X_{P_1}\times X_{P_2}$
