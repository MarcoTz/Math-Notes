Let $X_{\Sigma}$ be a [[Toric Variety]] corresponding to a [[Fan]] $\Sigma$. Then the following are equivalent 
* Every [[Weil Divisor]] on $X_{\Sigma}$ is a [[Cartier Divisor]] ([[Cartier Divisors on Toric Varieties]])
* $Pic(X_{\Sigma})=Cl(X_{\Sigma})$ 
* $X_{\Sigma}$ is smooth ([[Singularities]])

The following are also equivalent 
* Every Weil divisor on $X_{\Sigma}$ has a positive integer multiple that is Cartier (such Weil divisors are also called $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier)
* $Pic(X_{\Sigma})$ has finite index in $Cl(X_{\Sigma})$ 
* $\Sigma$ is simplicial
