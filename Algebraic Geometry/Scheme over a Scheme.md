Let $S$ be a fixed [[Scheme]], then a scheme $X$ with a morphism $X\rightarrow S$ is called a *scheme over S*. 

For two schemes $X,Y$ over $S$, a morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of schemes over $S$, also called an *$S$-morphism* is a morphism of schemes compatible with the given morphisms to $S$.

The [[Category]] of schemes over $S$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{Sch}(S)$. For a [[Ring]] $A$, we will write $\mathfrak{Sch}(A)$ for the category of schemes over $SpecA$ ([[Spectrum]]).
