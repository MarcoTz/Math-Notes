Let $\Lambda$ be a [[Lattice]] in $\mathbb{C}$ ([[Complex numbers]]) with basis $1,\tau$ for some $\tau \in \mathbb{C}\setminus \mathbb{R}$ (i.e $Im\tau \neq 0$).
Then an *elliptic function* wrt $\Lambda$ is a [[Meromorphic Function]] $f(z)$ s.t. $f(z+\omega) = f(z)$ for all $\omega\in \Lambda$.
Elliptic Functions are also called *doubly periodic functions*.

Sums, differences, products and quotients of elliptic functions are elliptic functions, thus elliptic functions on $\Lambda$ form a field.
The field of elliptic functions for a given $\Lambda$ is generated over $\mathbb{C}$ by the [[Weierstrass elliptic function]] $\wp$ and its derivative $\wp^{\prime}$.
