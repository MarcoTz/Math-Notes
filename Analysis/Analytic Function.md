Let $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) a function with $D\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) ([[Real Numbers]], [[Complex numbers]]).
Then $f$ is an analytic function if for $x_0\in D$ we have 

$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x-x_0)^n$$
for any $x\in D$.
Equivalently, $f$ is analytic if it is infinitely continuously differentiable ([[Differentiable Function]])
