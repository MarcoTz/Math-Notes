Let $U\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ ([[Complex numbers]]) and $f:U\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a function.
Then $f$ is *holomorphic* if at each point of $U$ the derivative of $f$ exists ([[Differentiable Function]])`.
If $f$ is holomorphic, then it is also an [[Analytic Function]].

$f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is holomorphic iff they satisfy the *Cauchy-Riemann equations*

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$ (where $\frac{\partial }{\partial}$ denotes the [[Partial Derivative]])
