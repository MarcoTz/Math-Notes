Let $f:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) be a function ([[Real Numbers]],[[Complex numbers]]) with $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) and $x_0\in U$. Then $f$ is called *differentiable* at $x_0$ if 

$$ f^{\prime}(x_0) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h}$$ exists.
Then $f$ is also continuous at $x_0$ ([[Continous Function]])..
If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ for all $x\in U$, then $f$ is differentiable on $U$.
If $f^{\prime}$ is also continuous, we say $f$ is continuously differentiable, and if $f^{\prime}$ is also (continuously) differentiable, $f$ is twice (continuously) differentiable and so on.
The $n$-th derivative of $f$ is denoted by $f^{(n)}$.
The set of $n$ times differentiable functions on some set $U$ is denoted by $C^n(U)$. 
If $f^{(n)}$ exists for all $n$, $f$ is infinitely continuously differentiable and we write $C^{\infty}(U)$ in this case.
$f\in C^{\infty}(U)$ is equivalent to $f$ being an [[Analytic Function]] on $U$.
