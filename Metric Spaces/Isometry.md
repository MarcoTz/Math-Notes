Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Metric Space]]s with metrics $d_X$ and $d_Y$ respectively. Then a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is called an *isometry* if $d_X(a,b) = d_Y(f(a),f(b))$.

All isometries are injective ([[Function#Injections, Surjections and Bijections]]).
A isometry is called a *global isometry* or *isometric isomorphism* if it is also surjective.
