The *euclidean space* of dimension $n$ is $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[Real Numbers]]).

It is a [[Metric Space]] with the *euclidean metric* $d(x,y) = ||x-y|| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and thus also a [[Topological Space]].
With point-wise addition and component-wise scalar multiplication, $\mathbb{R}^n$ is also a real [[Vector Space]].

For $n\neq m$ $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$ are not homeomorphic ([[Continous Function#Homeomorhpism]])

### Half-Spaces 

A half-space $\mathbb{H}$  in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as all points satisfying the linear inequalify 
$a_1x_1+\dots+a_nx_n \leq b$ for some $a\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $b\in \mathbb{R}$ 
Any half-space $\mathbb{H}$ defines a $n-1$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $a_1x_1+\dots+a_nx_n=b$, which is called the corresponding *hyperplane* of $\mathbb{H}$

### Division Algebra


If $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the structure of a Division [[Algebra]] over $\mathbb{R}$ then $n$ is a power of $2$
