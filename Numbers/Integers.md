The *integers*, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of the numbers $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots$ 
We can also write $\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{N} \cup -\mathbb{N}$ ([[Natural numbers]]).

$\mathbb{Z}$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ is an [[Euclidean Ring]], and also and infinite cyclic group ([[Abelian Group#Cyclic Groups]])

$\mathbb{Z}$ is a countably infinite set.
