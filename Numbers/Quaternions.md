The *Quaternions* $\mathbb{H}$ are an extension of [[Complex numbers]], they can be written as the [[Ring]] $\mathbb{R}[i,j,k]$ with the following relations between $i,j,k$

| * | **1** | **i** | **j** | **k** | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| **1** | 1 | i | j | k | 
| **i** | i | -1 | k | -j |
| **j** | j | -k | -1 | i | 
| **k** | k | j | -i | -1 | 

The quaternions are a division algebra ([[Algebra#Division Algebra]]) over $\mathbb{R}$.
