The *complex numbers* $\mathbb{C}$ is the algebraic closure of the [[Real Numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ (i.e. the smallest [[Field Extension]] that is algebraic).
It can also be defined as $\mathbb{R}(i)$ where $i^2=-1$. $i$ is called the *imaginary unit*.
Each element of $\mathbb{C}$ can be written as $a+bi$ where $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$
