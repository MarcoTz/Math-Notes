Given an $n$-sheeted covering space $\pi:\tilde{X} \rightarrow X$ ([[Covering Spaces]]) with $n<\infty$. Then there is a homomorphism $\tau : C_k(X) \rightarrow C_k(\tilde{X})$ assigning a singular simplex ([[Chain Complexes]],[[Singular Homology]]) $\sigma : \Delta^k \rightarrow X$ the sum of the $n$ distinct lifts $\tilde{\sigma}:\Delta^k \rightarrow \tilde{X}$. This is a chain map commuting with boundary homomorphisms.
The induced homomorhpisms on homology $\tau_* : H_k(X;G)\rightarrow H_k(\tilde{X};G)$ and $\tau^*:H^k(\tilde{X}:G)\rightarrow H^k(X;G)$ for any coefficient [[Group]] $G$ are called *transfer homomorphisms*.

We have $\tau^*\pi^* = n$.

If $\pi$ is defined by a group action of a group $\Gamma$ on $\tilde{X}$ and $F$ is a field with characteristic ([[Characteristic of a Field]]) either $0$ or a prime not diding $n$, then $\pi^*:H^k(X;F)\rightarrow H^k(\tilde{X};F)$ is injective and its image is the subgroup $H^*(\tilde{X};F)^{\Gamma}$ containing classes $\alpha$ with $\gamma^*(\alpha) = \alpha$ for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$
