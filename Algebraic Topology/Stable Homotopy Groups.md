For a connected ([[Connectedness]]) CW complex ([[Cell Complexes]] $X$, the suspension map ([[Suspension]]) $\pi_i(X) \rightarrow \pi_{i+1}(SX)$ is an isomorphism for $i<2n+1$ (i.e. $SX$ is $(n+1)$-connected ([[n-connectedness]])).
Therefore the following sequence eventually only contains isomorphisms 

$$ \pi_i(X) \rightarrow \pi_{i+1}(SX) \rightarrow \pi_{i+2}(S^2X) \rightarrow \dots $$
The resulting group is called *stable homotopy group* denoted by $\pi_i^s(X)$.
