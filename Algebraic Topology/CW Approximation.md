Let $X,Y$ be [[Cell Complexes]] and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a [[Continous Function]]. Then $f$ is called *weak homotopy equivalence* if it induces isomorphisms $\pi_n(X,x_0)\rightarrow \pi_n(Y,f(x_0))$ ([[Homotopy Groups]]) for all $n\geq 0$ (see [[Whitehead's Theorem]]).

For every cell complex $X$, there is a CW complex $Z$ and weak homotopy equivalence $f:Z\rightarrow X$.
If $X$ is path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]), $Z$ can be chosen to have a single $0$-cell with all other cells attached by basepoint-preserving maps.

CW approximations are unique up to homotopy equivalence (see [[CW Model]]).
Furthermore, weak homotopy equivalences induce isohorphicms on homology and cohomology ([[Homology]],[[Cohomology]]) for all $n$ and coefficient groups.
