A [[Topological Space]] $X$ with $\pi_n(X) \cong G$, $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for $i\neq 0$ and some [[Group]] $G$ is called *Eilenberg-MacLane space* $K(G,n)$.

If $G$ is abelian, there is a $K(G,n$) CW complex ([[Cell Complexes]]), whose homotopy type ([[Homotopy]]) is uniquely determined by $G$ and $n$.

### Connection with Cohomology 

There are natural bijections $T:\langle X, K(G,n) \rangle \rightarrow H^n(X;G)$ for all CW complexes $X$ and $n>0$ and [[Abelian Group]]s $G$.
$T$ has the form $T([f]) = f^*(\alpha)$ for a fixed $\alpha\in H^n(K(G,n);G)$ where $\langle X, K(G,n)\rangle$ is the set of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps $X\rightarrow K(G,n)$.
$\alpha$ is called a *fundamental class*
