For a path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]] [[Topological Space]] $X$, a *Postnikov Tower* is the following commutative diagram satisfying
![[Postnikov Tower diagram.png]]

* $X\rightarrow X_n$ induces an isomorphism on $\pi_i$ for $i\leq n$ ([[Homotopy Groups]])
* $pi_i(X_n) = 0$ for $i>n$

Any connected CW complex ([[Cell Complexes]]) $X$ has a Postnikov Tower with principal fibrations ([[Fibration]]) iff $\pi_1(X)$ acts trivially on $\pi_n(X)$ for all $n>1$ ([[Group Actions]])
