Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] that is the union of path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]) open sets $A_{\alpha}$ each containing the basepoint $x_0\in X$ and assume each $A_{\alpha}\cap A_{\beta}$ is also path-connected.
Then the homomorphism ([[The Fundamental Group#Induced Homomorophisms]]) $\Phi : \ast_{\alpha} \pi_1(A_{\alpha}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X,x_0)$  on the free product ([[Free Groups#Free Product]]) is surjective.
If furthermore each $A_{\alpha}\cap A_{\beta}\cap A_{\gamma}$ is path-connected, the kernel of $\Phi$ ([[Homomorphism]]) is the [[Normal Subgroup]] generated by elements $i_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)i_{\beta\alpha}(\omega)^{-1}$ where $i_{\alpha\beta}$ is the induced homomorphism by the inclusion $A_{\alpha}\cap A_{\beta} \hookrightarrow A_{\alpha}$ and $\omega \in \pi_1(A_{\alpha}\cap A_{\beta}$).
Then $\Phi$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_1(X,x_0)\cong \ast_{\alpha} \pi_1(A_{\alpha})/Ker\Phi$.
