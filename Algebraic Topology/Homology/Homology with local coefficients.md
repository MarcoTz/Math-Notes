Let $X$ be a path-connected [[Topological Space]] ([[Path Connectedness]]) with universal cover $\tilde{X}$ ([[Universal Covering Space]]) and fundamental group $\pi$ ([[The Fundamental Group]]).
Then the action ([[Group Actions]]) of $\pi$ by [[Deck Transformations]] on $\tilde{X}$ makes $X$ into the quotient of $\tilde{X}$ of this action and induces an action of $\pi$ on the group $C_n(\tilde{X})$ ([[Singular Homology]]) by sending $\sigma$ to the composition $\gamma\circ\sigma$. With this action $C_n(\tilde{X})$ is a module over $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$ which contains formal sums $\sum_i m_i \gamma_i$ with $m_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $\gamma_i\in\pi$ and obvious sums and products. 
Furthermore the boundary maps $\partial : C_n(\tilde{X}) \rightarrow C_{n-1}(\tilde{X})$ are $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$-module homomorphisms.
Then for an arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$-module $M$, the [[Tensor Product]]s $C_n(\tilde{X})\otimes_{\pi} M$ form a chain complex ([[Chain Complexes]]) with boundary maps $\delta\otimes \mathbb{1}$. The homology groups of this chain complex are called *homology groups with local coefficients*.
Similarly, using $C^n(X;M) = Hom_{\mathbb{Z}[\pi]}(C_m(\tilde{X}),M)$ we have a cochain complex with cohomology groups called *cohomology groups with local coefficients*.
