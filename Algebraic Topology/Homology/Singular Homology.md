Given a topological space $X$, we call [[Continous Function]]s $\sigma: \Delta^n\rightarrow X$ *singular $n$-simplices*.
If we denote the free groups generated by singular $n$-simplices on $X$ by $C_n(X)$ with boundary maps $\partial_n(\sigma) = \sum_i (-1)^i \sigma|_{[v_0,\dots,\hat{v_i},\dots, v_n]}$ we also get a chain complex ([[Chain Complexes]]) on $X$. 
The corresponding homology groups ([[Homology]]) are called *singular homology groups*.
The singular homology groups of a topological space $X$ is usually denoted by $H_n(X)$

If $X$ has path-components $X_{\alpha}$, we have $\bigoplus_{\alpha} H_n(X_{\alpha}) \cong H_n(X)$ for all $n$.
For any path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]) spcae $X$, we have $H_0(X)\cong \mathbb{Z}$.
If $X$ is only a point $H_n(X) = 0$ for all $n>0$ 

For two homotopy equivalent ([[Homotopy#Homotopy Equivalence]]) spaces, singular homology groups are isomorphic.
More generally, homotopic maps induce the same homomorphisms on homology.

Given a [[Continous Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$, the induced map $f_{\sharp} : C_n(X)\rightarrow C_{n}(Y)$ defines a chain map ([[Chain Complexes#Chain maps]]) 

### Exact Sequence of good pairs

If $(X,A)$ is a good pair ([[Retraction#Deformation Retraction]]), the we have an [[Exact Sequence]]

$$ \dots \rightarrow \tilde{H}_n(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \tilde{H}_n(X) \xrightarrow{j_*} \tilde{H}_n(X/A) \xrightarrow{\partial} \tilde{H}_{n-1}(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} \tilde{H}_{n-1}(X) \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \tilde{H}_0(X/A) \rightarrow 0$$ where $i$ is the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow X$ and $j$ is the quotient map ([[Topology/Quotient Space]]) $X\rightarrow X/A$. The map $\partial$ maps an element $x\in \tilde{H}_n(X/A)$ to a cycle $\partial x$ representing the homology class of a cycle $\partial \alpha$ in $A$, where $\alpha$ is a chain in  $X$ representing $x$.
Here, $\tilde{H}_n$ denotes the reduced homology groups ([[Homology#Reduced Homology]]).


### Betti Numbers

Since $H_n(X)\cong H_n^{\Delta}(X)$ for all $n$ and the $\Delta$-complex on $X$ ([[Delta-Complex]]) only has finitely many simplices, $H_n(X)$ can be written as a direct sum of cyclic groups ([[Abelian Group#Cyclic Groups]]). 
The number of summands in this sum is called the *$n$th Betti number of $X$* and the orders of the finite cyclic summands are called *torsion coefficients* of $X$.

### Moore Spaces 

Given an abelian group $G$ and $n\geq 1$, the *Moore space* $M(G,n)$ is the CW-complex ([[Cell Complexes]]) $X$ ([[Cell Complexes]]) with $H_n(X)\cong G$ and $H_i(X) = 0$ for $i\neq n$.
It is constructed from [[Wegde Sum]]s of circles indiced by a generating set of $G$. 
Using Moore spaces, we can construct CW complexes with any desired sequence of singular homology groups.

### Homology with coefficients

By replacing the chain groups $C_n(X)$ with the groups of formal sums $\sum_{k}g_k \sigma_k$ where $g_k$ are elements of some group $G$ other than $\mathbb{Z}$, we also get a chain complex, with the same boundary map $\partial$, The associated homology groups are called *homology groups with coefficients* in $G$, written $H_n(X;G)$. 
Relative and reduced homology groups ([[Homology#Reduced Homology]],[[Relative Homology]]) are defined the same way and denoted $H_n(X,A;G)$ and $\tilde{H}_n(X;G)$.
These groups have the same properties as regular simplicial homology groups, except for how the actual groups look.

### The Fundamental Group

For a space $X$, there is a homomorphism $h:\pi_1(X) \rightarrow H_1(X)$ by regarding loops as $1$-cycles ([[The Fundamental Group]]). If $X$ is path-connected ([[Connectedness]]), $h$ is surjective, and $H_1(X)\cong \pi_1(X)_{ab}$ where $\pi_1(X)_{ab}$ is the abelianization of $\pi_1(X)$ ([[Commutator]]).
