Let $X$ be an [[H-Space]] with multiplication $\mu:X\times X\rightarrow X$, the composition 

$$ H_*(X;R)\otimes H_*(X;R) \xrightarrow{\times} H_*(X\times X;R)\xrightarrow{\mu_*}H_*(X;R)$$
is called the *Pontryagin Product* (where the first map is the [[Cross Product]]). 
This product is associative if $\mu$ is associative or associative up to [[Homotopy]] (i.e. $(x,y,z)\mapsto \mu(x,\mu(y,z))$ and $(x,y,z)\mapsto \mu(\mu(x,y),z)$ are homotopic).
It is commutative if $\mu$ is commutative or commutative up to homotopy.
