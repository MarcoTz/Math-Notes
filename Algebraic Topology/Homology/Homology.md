Given an algebraic object $X$ (e.g. a [[Topological Space]]) and a chain complex ([[Chain Complexes]]) on $X$ the *$n$-th homology group* of $X$ wrt. the given chain complex, is defined as $H_n(X)=ker(\partial_n)/im(\partial_{n+1})$
Elements of $H_n(X)$ are called *homology classes* and two cycles in the same homology class are called *homologous*.


### Simplicial Homology

Given a $\Delta$-Complex ([[Delta-Complex]]) on a space $X$, we can define chain groups as the abelian groups $\Delta_n(X)$, which are the [[Free Groups]] generated by the $n$-simplices of $X$.
The boundary homomorphisms $\partial_n : \Delta_n(X)\rightarrow \Delta_{n-1}(X)$ are defined by $\partial_n(\sigma_{\alpha}) = \sum_i (-1)^i \sigma_{\alpha}|_{[v_0,\dots,\hat{v_i},\dots,v_n]}$ and continuing by the homomorphism properties.
With this definition, $\Delta_n(X),\partial_n$ define a chain complex on $X$, and the corresponding homology groups are called *simplicial homology groups* of $X$. They are sometimes denoted by $H^{\Delta}_n(X)$.
Simplical and Singular homology groups ([[Singular Homology]]) are isomorphic for all $n$.

### Reduced Homology

Given a chain complex $C_n,\partial_n$, we can create a new chain complex by setting $\tilde{C}_n = C_{n-1}$ and $\tilde{\partial}_n = \partial_{n-1}$ for $n>0$ and $\tilde{C_0}=\mathbb{Z}$, $\partial_0=\varepsilon$ where $\varepsilon(\sum n_i\sigma_i) \sum n_i$.
This is called the *reduced chain complex* of the original one, and the homology groups are called *reduced homology groups*.
The reduced singular homology groups of a point are then $0$ for all $n$ instead of only for $n>0$.
We have $\tilde{H}_n \cong H_n$ for $n>0$ and $\tilde{H}_0 \cong H_0\oplus \mathbb{Z}$ 

### Induced Homomorphisms

Given a chain map $f:C_n\rightarrow D_n$ ([[Chain Complexes#Chain maps]]) , the induced maps $f_*:H_n(C_n)\rightarrow H_n(D_n)$ on the homology groups are homomorphisms. The induced homomorphisms have the following properties:

1. $(fg)_* = f_*g_*$ 
2. $\mathbb{1}_* = \mathbb{1}$
