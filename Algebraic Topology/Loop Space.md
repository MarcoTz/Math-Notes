For a [[Topological Space]] $X$ the *loop space* $\Omega X$ is the space of loops in $X$ at some chosen basepoint $x_0\in X$ with basepoint the constant loop at $x_0$.

$\Omega X$ has the subspace topology of $X^I$, the space of all maps $I\rightarrow X$.
$\Omega X$ is an [[Abelian Group]] with composition of loops.
