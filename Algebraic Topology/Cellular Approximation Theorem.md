Let $X,Y$ be [[Cell Complexes]] and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a map with $f(X^n)\subseteq Y^n$ for all $n$. Then $f$ is called *cellular map*.

Every map $f$ between CW complexes is homotopic ([[Homotopy]]) to a cellular map. If $f$ is cellular on a subcomplex $A\subseteq X$, the homotopy can be taken to be stationary on $A$.
