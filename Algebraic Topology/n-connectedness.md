A [[Topological Space]] $X$ with is called $n$-connected if $\pi_i(X,x_0) = 0$ ([[Homotopy Groups]]) for $i\leq n$.
$0$-connected means path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]) and $1$-connected means simply-connected ([[The Fundamental Group#Simply Connected Spaces]]).

The following conditions are equivalent 
* Every map $S^i\rightarrow X$ is homotopic ([[Homotopy]]) to a constant map 
* Every map $S^i\rightarrow X$ extends to a map $D^{i+1}\rightarrow X$ 
* $\pi_i(X,x_0) = 0$ for all $x_0\in X$

A CW pair ([[Cell Complexes]]) $(X,A)$ is $n$-connected if all cells in $X\setminus A$ have dimension greater than $n$. In particular, the pair $(X,X^n)$ is $n$-connected, so the inclusion $X^n\hookrightarrow X$ induces isomorphisms on $\pi_i$ for $i<n$ and a surjection on $\pi_n$.
