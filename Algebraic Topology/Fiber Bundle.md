A *fiber bundle* on a [[Topological Space]] $E$ with fiber $F$consists of a map $p:E\rightarrow B$ (called the projection) s.t. for each $b\in B$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $b$ and a homeomorphism ([[Continous Function#Homeomorhpism]]) $h:p^{-1}(U) \rightarrow U\times F$ s.t. we have a commutative diagram.

$h$ is called *local trivialization* of the bundle, $B$ the *base space* and $E$ the *total space*.

Fiber bundles have the [[Homotopy Lifting Property]] wrt all CW pairs ([[Cell Complexes]]) $(X,A)$.
