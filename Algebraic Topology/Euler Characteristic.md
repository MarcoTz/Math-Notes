For $2$-dimensional CW complexes $X$ (i.e. [[Graph]]s considered as $0$-cells vertices, $1$-cells edges and $2$-cells faces), the *Euler Characteristic* $\chi(X)$ of $X$ is defined as 

$$\chi(X) = \#Vertices - \#Edges + \#Faces $$For higher-dimensional (but still finite dimensional) CW complexes, the euler characteristic is then generalized to 

$$ \chi(X) = \sum_{n} (-1)^n c_n $$ where $c_n$ is the number of $n$-dimensional cells in $X$. 
With [[Singular Homology]] Grups, we have the formula 

$$ \chi(X) =\sum(X)(-1)^n rankH_n(X)$$
