For $2$-dimensional CW complexes $X$ (i.e. [[Graph]]s considered as $0$-cells vertices, $1$-cells edges and $2$-cells faces), the *Euler Characteristic* $\chi(X)$ of $X$ is defined as 

$$\chi(X) = \#Vertices - \#Edges + \#Faces $$For higher-dimensional (but still finite dimensional) CW complexes, the euler characteristic is then generalized to 

$$ \chi(X) = \sum_{n} (-1)^n c_n $$ where $c_n$ is the number of $n$-dimensional cells in $X$. 
With [[Singular Homology]] Groups, we have the formula 

$$ \chi(X) =\sum(X)(-1)^n rankH_n(X)$$

(see [[Abelian Group#Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]]])

More generally, if  $C$ is a [[Complex]] on $X$ s.t. the [[Cohomology]] groups $H^i(C)$ are [[Vector Space]]s  over some [[Field]] $k$, then 

$$ \chi(C) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i dim_k(H^i(C))$$ if this sum is finite.
For a [[Scheme]] $X$ over a field $k$ with structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ we write $\chi(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ for the euler characteristic with cohomology groups $H^i(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ .

A closed [[Topological Manifold]] of odd dimension has Euler characteristic $0$.
