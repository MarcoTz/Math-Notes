Given a [[Topological Space]] $X$ and a subspace $A\subseteq X$ a *retraction* $r:X\rightarrow X$ is a [[Continous Function]], s.t. $r|_A = \mathbb{1}$ ([[Function#Restriction]]) and $r(X) = A$. 

### Deformation Retraction

A *deformation retraction* of a space $X$ to a subspace $A$ is a restriction $r:X\rightarrow X$ of $X$ to $A$, that is homotopic to the identity map of $A$ ([[Homotopy]])

### Induced Homomorphisms of Retractions

If $X$ retracts to a subspace $A$, the homomorphism ([[The Fundamental Group#Induced Homomorophisms]]) $i_*:\pi_1(A,x_0)\rightarrow \pi_1(X,x_0)$ induced by the inclusion is injective.
If $X$ deformation retracts to $A$ it is an isomorphism.

If $A$ is a nonempty subspace of some space $X$ and $A$ is a deformation retraction of some neighborhood of $A$ in $X$, we say $(X,A)$ is a *good pair*.
