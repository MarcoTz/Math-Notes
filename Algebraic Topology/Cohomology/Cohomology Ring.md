For a [[Topological Space]]  $X$ and coefficient [[Ring]] $R$, let $H^*(X;R)$ be the direct product ([[Group Products]]) of the [[Cohomology]] groups $H^n(X;R)$.
With the distributive and associative [[Cup Product]], this defines a ring, called the *cohomology ring*.

The decomposition of $H^*$ into cohomology groups $H^n$ , defines the structure of a [[Graded Ring]] on $H^*$
