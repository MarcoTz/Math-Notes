For a [[Topological Space]] $X$ and commutative coefficient [[Ring]] $R$, the *cross product* or *external cup product* is defined as 

$$ H^*(X;R)\times H^*(Y;R \xrightarrow{\times} H^*(X\times Y;R)$$ $$ a\times b = p_1^*(a)\smile p^*_2(b)$$
Where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the projections $X\times Y\rightarrow X$ and $X\times Y\rightarrow Y$.

Using the [[Tensor Product]] the cross product extents to a [[Ring Homomorphism]] $H^*(X;R)\otimes H^*(Y;R)\rightarrow H^*(X\times Y;R)$ 
where multiplication on the tensor product of [[Graded Ring]]s is defined as $(a\otimes b)(c\otimes d) = (-1)^{|b||c|}ac\otimes bd$ 
This cross product on tensor products is an isomorphism of rings if $X$ and $Y$ are [[Cell Complexes]] and $H^k(Y;R)$ is a finitely generated free $R$-[[Module]] for all $k$. This result is known as a *KÃ¼nneth Formula*
