A covering space ([[Covering Spaces]]) $\tilde{X}$ of a [[Topological Space]] $X$ is called *universal cover* of $X$, if it is simply connected ([[The Fundamental Group#Simply Connected Spaces]]). 
Universal covers are unique up to homeomorphism.

A space $X$ is called *semilocally simply-connected*, if for each $x\in X$ there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, s.t. the inclusion-induced homomorphism $\pi_1(U,x)\rightarrow \pi_1(X,x)$ is trivial.

If $X$ is a space that is path-connected ([[Path Connectedness]]), locally path-connected and semilocally simply-connected, then there exists a simply-connected covering space of $X$.
More generally, in this case, for each subgroup $H$ of $\pi_1(X)$ there is a covering space of $X$, that has $H$ as fundamental group.
