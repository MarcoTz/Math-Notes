In an *axiomatic system*, also called *Hilbert style system*, there are given [[Assertions]], for example $\vdash A\supset B$, called the axioms.
All other assertions are done using rules of inference that give an assertion called the *conclusion* from several *premises*.

For propositional logic, there is only a single rule of inference:
$$ \frac{\vdash A \supset B \quad \vdash A}{\vdash B}$$
