This is a system similar to [[Sequent Calculus for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic]], but as an axiomatic system ([[Axiomatic Logical Systems]]).
It has the following axioms

It's only logical rule is the following
$$ \frac{\vdash A \supset B \quad \vdash A}{\vdash B}$$ 

If a formula $C$ is derivable in this system, then the sequent $\Rightarrow C$ is derivable in the sequent calculus system for intuitionistic logic.
