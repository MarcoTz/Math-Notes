Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] and $R$ a [[Ring]], then the cap product is an $R$-bilinear map defined as the following

$$ \frown : C_k(X;R)\times C^l(X;R) \rightarrow C_{k-l}(X;R) $$
$$ \sigma \frown \varphi = \varphi(\sigma|_{[v_0,\dots,v_l]}\sigma|_{[v_l,\dots,v_k]})$$ where $C_k$ and $C^l$ denote the chain groups in [[Singular Homology]]] and [[Cohomology]]. This induces the cap product on homology

$$ H_k(X;R)\times H^l(X;R)\overset{\frown}{\longrightarrow} H_{k-l}(X;R)$$
$$H_k(X,A;R)\times H^l(X;R) \overset{\frown}{\longrightarrow} H_{k-l}(X,A;R)$$
$$ H_k(X,A;R)\times H^l(X,A;R) \overset{\frown}{\longrightarrow} H_{k-l}(X;R)$$
(on [[Relative Homology]]).

We have the following formula connecting the cap product and the [[Cup Product]]

$$ \psi(\alpha \frown \varphi) = (\varphi \smile \psi)(\alpha) $$
