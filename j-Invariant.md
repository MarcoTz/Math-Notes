Let $X$ be an elliptic curve ([[Genus of a Curve]]) over an algebraically closed [[Field]] $k$. 
For a point $P_0\in X$ we have the linear system $|2P_0|$ ([[Linear Systems]]) which by Riemann-Roch ([[The Riemann-Roch Theorem]]) has dimension $1$ and thus defines a morphism $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ ([[Projective Space]]) of degree $2$ ([[Degree of a Morphism of Curves]]).
Then $f$ is ramified at $4$ points ([[Ramification]]), $\infty,a,b,c$, and we have an automorphism on $\mathbb{P}^1$ $x^{\prime} = (x-a)/(b-a)$ s.t. $x^{\prime}(a)=0$, $x^{\prime}(b) = 1$.
Then $f$ is branched over $0,1,\lambda,\infty$ with $\lambda \neq 0,1$.
Now the *j-invariant* of $X$ is defined as 

$$ j = 2^8\frac{(\lambda^2-\lambda+1)^3}{\lambda^2(\lambda-1)^2}$$ 
If $k$ has characteristic $\neq 2$ ([[Characteristic of a Field]]) we have 
* $j$ only depends on $X$
* two elliptic curves $X$ and $X^{\prime}$ are isomorphic iff $j(X)=j(X^{\prime})$ 
* every element of $k$ is the $j$-invariant of some elliptic curve $X$ over $k$
